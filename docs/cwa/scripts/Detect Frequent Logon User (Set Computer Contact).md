## Summary

This script is designed to gather the frequently logged-in domain users on the workstations and set the associated contact to the computer in Automate.

It detects the users present at the **path C:/Windows/System32/lsass.exe**, which refers to a crucial system file in Microsoft Windows operating systems. Hereâ€™s what it does:

lsass.exe stands for Local Security Authority Subsystem Service.  
This file is a critical component of Microsoft Windows security policies, domain authentication, and Active Directory management on your computer.  
It is responsible for enforcing the security policy on the system, verifying users logging on to a Windows computer or server, handling password changes, and creating access tokens.

The user who was detected most in `@DaysToCheck@` is set as the Frequent user, and the script sets the corresponding contact to the computer associated in Automate.
