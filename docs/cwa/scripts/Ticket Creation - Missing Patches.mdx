## Summary

This script is a complete ticket creation script only to be used with the ProVal - Production - Patching - Missing 5+ Patches but should be able to work as long as the count of patches is getting returned to the %result% variable.

## Monitor Driven Only

This script is designed to be monitor driven only and should never be manually run. If it is manually run, the script will simply exit on the first step in the else section.

## Dependencies

This script's only dependency is that the monitor that is triggering the script has the count of missing patches reporting in as the result (TestValue). The script will gather all other information it needs.

## Process

1. Gather information based on the network deviceID that the monitor has reported.
2. Create a ticket for machines missing patches, listing them all out accordingly.
