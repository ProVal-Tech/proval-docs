## Summary

This script is a replication of the [CWM - Automate - Script - Ticket Creation - Computer](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-9098338) script, with the key distinction being that it generates client-level tickets instead of computer-level tickets.

It is imperative to incorporate the `Clientid` in the SQL query of a RAWSQL monitor set when utilizing this script for alerting in conjunction with the monitor set. This ensures that the script functions correctly and aligns with the monitoring and alerting requirements.
