## Summary

This script is for clients that would like to optimize their ticket routing from Automate. Instead of having vague ticket categories in Automate like 'backups' or 'server' that don't express where that ticket goes, we here at ProVal like to create categories that are descriptive and exact. The script can be run against Automate Server even though any system will work as this script only runs SQL.

**Time Saved by Automation:** 30 Minutes

## Sample Run

## Dependencies

## Variables

| **Variable Name**        | **Description**                                                                                       |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| InfoCats                 | This variable will store the value of the SQL statement like (CategoryName, Related, Keywords, Description, image, listhide) |
| UpdateExistingInfoCats   | This variable will hold the values of the SQL statement which updates the name of the categories.    |

#### Global Parameters

| Name                       | Example | Required | Description                                                                                             |
|----------------------------|---------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I have backed up the db    | 1       | True     | This represents that the DB has been backed up prior to making any changes to the ticket categories.   |

## Process

This script will create Information Base Categories based on which boards are imported in the Connectwise Manage Plugin. These Categories will be named 'AA - Board - Type - Priority' EX:

![Process Example](../../../static/img/Build-and-Map-Information-Base-Categories-from-CWM(board-Type)/image_2.png)

There is another option for clients that have subtypes and are using them; this one will create all the categories for Board, Type, and subtype at each priority. **NOTE:** This script will create a TON of entries if you use the Board Type SubType flavor, so be warned. In our test environment, it equated to ~2000 entries.

It is highly recommended if you have not already to set your priorities in manage to 'P1'-'P5' vs 'Low Priority 5' or another long string. A number system maps easier and is easier to read briefly in the UI. If you are going to use this script, it is also recommended to organize the types (or subtypes) for all your boards in manage, cleaning up options that are not in use.

**BEFORE running this script after making changes in manage, run 'system checks' from the manage plugin in order to update the boards, status, types, and subtypes that the Manage Plugin sees.**

This script runs only SQL against the database. It is set up to dynamically attempt to update all existing mappings to use the new setup within plugins and other locations.
