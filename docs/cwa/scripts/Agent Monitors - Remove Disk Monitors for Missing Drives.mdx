## Summary

This script is used to clean up older remote drive space monitors for drives that no longer exist on Windows systems. 

If there are tickets related to the following example message, this script should be run against those systems.  
**Example:**  
"Unable to query drive 'H:' for free space as the drive is not found: Could not find the drive 'H://'. The drive might not be ready or might not be mapped."

Or if there are Remote (System) monitors showing similar "Return Information" to the screenshot below.
