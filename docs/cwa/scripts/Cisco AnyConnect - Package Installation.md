## Summary

An agnostic wrapper for the [Install-Anyconnect agnostic script](https://proval.itglue.com/5078775/docs/11897620).

## Sample Run

- Please review the Client-level EDFs found below. If you intend to install Umbrella or all applications in the package, populate the EDFs with accurate information.
- This is not mandatory; however, it eliminates the need to add additional calls to the Arguments parameter.

![Image 1](../../../static/img/Cisco-AnyConnect---Package-Installation/image_1.png)

An empty Arguments parameter installs only the core-vpn module.

![Image 2](../../../static/img/Cisco-AnyConnect---Package-Installation/image_2.png)

Passing the -All argument will only work if the EDFs above are properly set.

![Image 3](../../../static/img/Cisco-AnyConnect---Package-Installation/image_3.png)

If the above EDFs are not set, you must provide the ClientID, Fingerprint, and OrgID. This applies when running the -Umbrella switch as well.

![Image 4](../../../static/img/Cisco-AnyConnect---Package-Installation/image_4.png)

Individual components may also be installed. Please reference the documentation for the [Install-Anyconnect Agnostic Script](https://proval.itglue.com/5078775/docs/11897620).
