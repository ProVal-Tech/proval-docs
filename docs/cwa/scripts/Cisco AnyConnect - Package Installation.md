## Summary

An agnostic wrapper for the [Install-Anyconnect agnostic script](https://proval.itglue.com/5078775/docs/11897620).

## Sample Run

- Please review the Client-level EDFs found below. If you intend on installing Umbrella or all applications in the package then populate the EDFs with accurate information.
- This is not mandatory; however, it eliminates the need to add additional calls to the Arguments parameter.

![Image 1](5078775/docs/11877090/images/16652095)

An empty Arguments parameter installs only the core-vpn module.

![Image 2](5078775/docs/11877090/images/16652222)

Passing the -All argument along will only work if the EDFs above are properly set.

![Image 3](5078775/docs/11877090/images/16652249)

If the above EDFs are not set you must provide the ClientID, Fingerprint, and OrgID. This applies when running the -Umbrella switch as well.

![Image 4](5078775/docs/11877090/images/16652352)

Individual components may also be installed. Please reference the documentation for the [Install-Anyconnect Agnostic Script](https://proval.itglue.com/5078775/docs/11897620).
