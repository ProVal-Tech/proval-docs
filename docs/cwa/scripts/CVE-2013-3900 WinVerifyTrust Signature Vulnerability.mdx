| DetectionOnly               | This collects client-EDF 'CVE Vulnerability Detection Only' data for the agent where the script is deployed. If it is 1, then the CVE-2013-3900-only detection will run and register to the dataview without remediation.                                                                                   |
| Detection-Remediation       | This collects data from client-EDF 'CVE-2013-3900 Vul Detection and Remediation for the agent where the script is deployed. If it is 1, then the CVE-2013-3900 vulnerability will be detected, if found vulnerable then attempt to remediate it and log the result to the dataview [CWA Dataview - CVE-2013-3900 WinVerifyTrust Signature Audit](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-17229164). |
| RemediationStatusCheck      | This contains a report on whether the remediation was successful or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| psout                       | It contains the complete output of the PowerShell execution for the CVE detection/remediation action.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| TicketCreation              | It contains the ticket categoryID applied on the monitor [CWA Remote Monitor - CVE-2013-3900 WinVerifyTrust Signature Validation](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-17229186). Only the ticket will be created if the category is set.                                                                |
