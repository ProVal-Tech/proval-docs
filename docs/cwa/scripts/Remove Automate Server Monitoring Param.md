## Summary

The script can be used to remove the content of [Automate Server Monitoring](https://proval.itglue.com/5078775/docs/10390988) from the environment. Only the pieces emailing ProVal will be removed.  
There's an additional parameter that provides you an option to remove ProSyncClient Plugin as well.  

It is developed as a client script, so that no one mistakenly executes the script against any machine. Execute and Edit Permissions are limited to the `Super Admin` only.  

**WARNING: THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DESTRUCTIVE SCRIPT. DO NOT EXECUTE THE SCRIPT UNLESS YOU ARE 100% SURE. DO NOT IMPORT THE SCRIPT TO ANY PARTNER FOR NO REASON. CONSULTANTS' CONSENT IS NECESSARY BEFORE EXECUTING THE SCRIPT. NEVER EXECUTE THE SCRIPT IN OUR (PROVAL'S) INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT.**

## Sample Run

A client script can either be debugged or can be executed against any client. The suggested method is to debug the script.
