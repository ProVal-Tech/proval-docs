## Summary

The script will gather the KBIDs from [New Patch Deny Process](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-8524500) and deny the patches listed.

Time saved by automation: 20 Minutes

## Sample Run

## Dependencies

[https://proval.itglue.com/5078775/docs/8524500](https://proval.itglue.com/5078775/docs/8524500)

## Variables

- `@KBID@`: To store the output of the PowerShell query fetching the KBIDs from [https://proval.itglue.com/5078775/docs/8524500](https://proval.itglue.com/5078775/docs/8524500).
- `@ApprovalPolicyID@`: To store the ID of the default approval policy.

## Process

Step 1: Add the KBID of the patches to be denied after the "Patches_To_DENY:" string under the URL [https://proval.itglue.com/5078775/docs/8524500](https://proval.itglue.com/5078775/docs/8524500). KBIDs should be comma separated and there shouldn't be a space in between or after the ids. As mentioned in the attached screenshots:

Step 2: A PowerShell query will fetch those KBIDs to the script and will store those KBIDs under the `@KBID@` variable.

Step 3: The default approval policy ID will be saved under the `@ApprovalPolicyID@` variable.

Step 4: The script will fetch the hotfix ID for each KBID and will deny those hotfix IDs for `@ApprovalPolicyID@` regardless of the current state.

## Output

Output can be checked from the Approval section of the patch manager.
