## Summary

This script is a complete ticket creation script only to be used with the ESXi Bad Sensor Monitor.

## Monitor Driven Only

This script is designed to be monitor driven only and should never be manually run. If it is manually run, the script will simply exit on the first step in the else section.

## Dependencies

This script's only dependency is that the monitor that is triggering the script has the network deviceID reporting in as the fieldname. The script will gather all other information it needs.

## Process

1. Gather information based on the network deviceID that the monitor has reported.
2. Create a ticket for ESXi Bad sensors, listing them all out accordingly.
