## Summary

This is a wrapper script that can be used to offboard machines from the client's environment by defining the scripts to be run before offboarding the machine. This script calls a template script "Offboarding Scripts - Partner" from which any of the subscripts that have to be run before offboarding can be run. If any of the child scripts fail to run, the parent script will not proceed for Screenconnect or Automate agent removal.

Note: All changes have to be done in [CWM - Automate - Template - Offboarding Scripts - Partner](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-15281996) only. No alteration is required in the wrapper script.

It will not remove the Automate agent.- "`Best Effort - Continue`" - Continue for Screenconnect and Automate agent removal even though any child script fails to run. It will not create any failure tickets.- "`Ticket+Continue`" - Continue for Screenconnect and Automate agent removal even though any child script fails to run.

## Ticketing

**Computer Level ticketing**  
**Subject:** `Offboarding status on %ComputerName%(%ComputerID%)`

**Ticket Body:** `OffBoarding Script Ran on the machine %Computername%. Here are the script results..!!`  
`Script has successfully removed the following applications:@Success@`  
`The applications below have failed to uninstall, please look into these failures:@Failure@`  
If any application fails to uninstall, it is likely that the machine needs to be rebooted before the tools will show as removed. Please work with the end user to get the device rebooted and then we can attempt the offboarding process again. If it fails again, you will likely have to remove the last bits of software manually...sorry! Once you've removed that pesky software, please run the Offboarding script again to remove the Automate agent from the device.

**Client Level ticketing:**  
**Subject:** `Offboarding initiated on client - %ClientName%`  
`%ScriptName% has been initiated to offboard all machines of this client.`

**Location Level ticketing:**  
**Subject:** `Offboarding initiated on location - %LocationName%`  
**Ticket Body:** `It seems like "Offboard Location" EDF has been selected for %LocationName%.%ScriptName% has been initiated to offboard all machines under this location.`
