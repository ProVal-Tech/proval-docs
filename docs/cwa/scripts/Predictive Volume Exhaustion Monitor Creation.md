## Summary

The script is designed to set up the [Volume Space Prediction](<../monitors/EPM - Disk - Remote Monitor - Volume Space Prediction.md>) Remote monitor for Windows machines. [Volume Space Sampling](<../monitors/EPM - Disk - Remote Monitor - Volume Space Sampling.md>) monitors will be created when the `Auditing` feature is active.

The remote monitors are compatible with the following operating systems:
- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2022

The implementation of these remote monitors is controlled by system properties and Extra Data Fields (EDFs). The specifics of these configurations are elaborated on in this document.

## Sample Run

**First Run:**  
Run/Debug the script against any random client with the `Set_Environment` parameter set to `1` to create the system properties and the extra data fields used by the script. It will also remove the deprecated version of the solution from the environment.

**Script Schedule:**  
It is a client script and is suggested to schedule it to run once per day for best results.

## Dependencies

[EPM - Disk - Agnostic - Get-VolumeExhaustionEstimate](<../../powershell/Get-VolumeExhaustionEstimate.md>)

## Remote Monitors

- [EPM - Disk - Remote Monitor - Volume Space Prediction](<../monitors/EPM - Disk - Remote Monitor - Volume Space Prediction.md>)
- [EPM - Disk - Remote Monitor - Volume Space Sampling](<../monitors/EPM - Disk - Remote Monitor - Volume Space Sampling.md>)

## User Parameters

| Name                          | Example | Required                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|---------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Set_Environment               | 1       | True (for first run only)   | Set it to 1 during the first run of the script to generate the necessary system properties and EDFs for managing the generated remote monitors. It will also remove the deprecated version of the solution from the environment. |
| Clean_Environment             | 0       | False                        | This is a potentially destructive option. Setting this parameter to 1 while running the script will remove all the remote monitors, system properties, and EDFs generated by the script. **USE WITH CAUTION**                    |
