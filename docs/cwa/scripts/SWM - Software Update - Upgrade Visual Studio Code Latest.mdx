## Summary

The purpose of the script is to update the installed version of the Visual Studio Code to the latest available version.

If `User Installer` is installed then the user must be logged on to the computer for the script to work. If the user is using the application then they will be prompted to close:  
![Close Application Prompt](../../../static/img/SWM---Software-Update---Upgrade-Visual-Studio-Code-Latest/image_1.png)

The Application cannot be upgraded if it's running.  

This prompt is inevitable for computers with the `User Installer` version of the application installed and should not be canceled:

**Note:** The script cannot be used to install a new instance of the application.
