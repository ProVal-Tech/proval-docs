## Summary

This script will take a parents `psout` variable and check it for known common errors, convert that error into a human readable format, and log that error in human readable format on the script log. This is particularly useful when attempting to determine why a PowerShell command didn't run as expected, and can be instrumental in testing, troubleshooting, and development of future scripts.

This script has been used in 12 scripts as a method of troubleshooting, it has gone from 3 known errors to now 7 and can be added to quite easily.

## Sample Run

This script should always be called from a parent script.

1. On any parent script where a PowerShell command is being run, save the output to the variable `@psout@`.
2. Run the Powershell Response - All Errors - Check script immediately after setting the `@psout@` variable.
3. After running that script check the state of the `@failstatus@` variable in the script, if the state is False, then the PowerShell command that was run had triggered in the error check and a log should be present in the `@environmentalError@` variable.

## Dependencies

- A `@psout@` variable must be present in the script at the time of calling this script.

## Variables

| Name              | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EnvironmentalError | This variable sets the human readable interpretation of the error held in the `@psout@` variable. |

## Process

1. If Check `@psout@` for a specific string.
   1. Set the `@EnvironmentalError@` variable to what the specific string reflects.
   2. Log Error and exit with error.
2. Go back to step 1 until all known strings are queried.
3. Exit script.

## Output

- Script log
- `@failstatus@` variable state.
- `@EnvironmentalError@` variable.
