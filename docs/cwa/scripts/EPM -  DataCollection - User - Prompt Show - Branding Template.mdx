## Summary

This Automate Script is intended to set branding standards for a client. Its only intended purpose is to set variables to be used for calling the User Prompt - Show script and provide a standard branded messaging theme for clients.

## Sample Run

This Script is a Branding Script for the User Prompt - Show script and should never be run manually; it should only be called from other scripts and before running the proval/Windows/User Prompt - Show script. Running this script manually will result in nothing happening at all. It simply sets variables to the desired values. To use this script, copy and paste the lines in the Else section of this script into the desired script, enable the desired functions and set their values, and enable the two run script lines.
