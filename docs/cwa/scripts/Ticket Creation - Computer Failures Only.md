## Summary

It is an exact copy of the [CWM - Automate - Script - Ticket Creation - Computer](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-9098338) script with the exception that it now refrains from executing actions for monitors with `SUCCESS` or `WARNING` statuses.

Should be executed from an alert template only. Currently, it's implemented in the `â–³ Custom - Ticket Creation Computer - Failures Only` alert template.
