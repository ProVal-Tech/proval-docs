## Summary

This script detects Dell Dockstation on Dell Workstations. Since `Dell Command | Monitor` is required to be installed to detect the dockstations, it will install it if it's not already installed and will proceed to run the commands to detect Dockstations.

The script will validate the prerequisites before attempting to install the application. It can create a ticket if the pre-req validation fails. It will also attempt to install `Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable` if the required version is not installed.

Computer level EDF `Unsupported Dell Bios` will be marked for the computers not having a supported BIOS.

Pre-req:  
[Prerequisites for Systems Running on Windows](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/command-monitor/dellcommandmonitor_rn/prerequisites-for-systems-running-on-windows?guid=guid-aa49b007-8eb3-496b-851b-d2131a8c74b6&lang=en-us)

## Dependencies

[CWM - Automate - Script - OverFlowedVariable - SQL Insert - Execute](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10546355)
