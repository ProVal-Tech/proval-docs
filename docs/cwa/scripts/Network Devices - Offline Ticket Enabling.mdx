## Implementation

1. Import the contents  
   - [Script - Ticket Creation - Offline Network Devices](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-13343875) 
   - Alert Template: "**△ Custom - Ticket Creation - Offline Network Devices**" 
   - Script - Network Devices - Offline Ticket Enabling [Param]

2. Reload the system cache  
   ![Image](../../../static/img/Network-Devices---Offline-Ticket-Enabling/image_7.png)  

3. Configure the solution as follows:  
   - Navigate to Automation --> Scripts within the CWA Control Center.  
     - Debug the [Script - Network Devices - Offline Ticket Enabling](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-16290414) on any client with User Parameter 'Set_environment' = 1  
     - It will create the System property required for the script.  
   - Navigate to system dashboard --> Config --> Properties  
     - Fill in the `NetworkDevice_Manufacturer` system property as per partner requirements.  
     - **Important:** Do not proceed with implementing this script unless the consultant provides the type of network devices the partner wants to sync. Contact the consultant to obtain this information.  
     - By default, it remains empty  
       ![Image](../../../static/img/Network-Devices---Offline-Ticket-Enabling/image_8.png)  
     - If Partner wants to set offline ticketing for all devices, put "ALL" in the `NetworkDevice_Manufacturer` system property as shown below:  
       ![Image](../../../static/img/Network-Devices---Offline-Ticket-Enabling/image_9.png)  
     - If Partner wants to set offline ticketing for a particular manufacturer type of network device like Meraki, Ubiquiti, etc., fill in the system property as shown below. Separate each type with a pipeline (|)  
       ![Image](../../../static/img/Network-Devices---Offline-Ticket-Enabling/image_10.png)  
     - If the partner wants to remove the offline ticketing the device script synced earlier, put "Disable" in the system property as shown below:  
       ![Image](../../../static/img/Network-Devices---Offline-Ticket-Enabling/image_11.png)  
   - Navigate to system dashboard --> Management --> Scheduled Client Scripts  
     - Schedule the [Script - Network Devices - Offline Ticket Enabling](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-16290414) to run daily.  
       ![Image](../../../static/img/Network-Devices---Offline-Ticket-Enabling/image_2.png)  
   - If the partner wants to exclude any particular device, location, or client from external Sync, select the `Exclude from Offline Network Device Ticketing` EDF respectively on that device, location, or client.
