## Summary

This is a duplicate of [CWM - Automate - Script - Automate Agent - Duplicate Serial Number - Retire](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5081588-9095605) script. But instead of retiring it will audit the duplicate agents from the Automate environment. The duplicate agent will be identified based on serial number, name, and Client affiliation.

This is a client script and will work only for the Physical Machines. Virtual Machines are excluded to prevent any accidental deletion. It can be set up to email the results to any email address or a ticket can also be generated with the list of duplicate agents.

## Sample Run

Set the parameter `Set_environment` for first execution.

Specify the email address where you would like to receive the output of the result.

## Output

- Script Logs
- Ticketing
- Email

## Ticketing/Email

Tickets will only be generated if the system property `_sysDuplicateAgentTicketingEnable` is set to '1'.

**Subject:** `Duplicate Agents Based on Serial Numbers`

**Body:** `Please review the following duplicates. These are instances where multiple Automate agent IDs have the same serial number. This usually happens when a computer is re-imaged and the old agent is not retired first. Typically any agent IDs with the oldest Last Contact dates can be retired, but these should be verified first.`

Keeping this list clean prevents false positive alerts from generating from the old agent instance, and frees up Automate agent licenses. If all of the older copies of the agents listed below are deemed to be safe for removal, you can run the script (ProVal Script - noted below) to retire them all at once. Please use the Audit Only version of the script first if you would like to see a report of what the automation would do first.

Script Name - Automate Agent - Duplicate Serial Number - Auto Retire [Email, Ticket]

Duplicate Agents are listed below:

`@DuplicateMachines@`

In case there is no duplicate serial number:

`No duplicate Machines identified based on Serial Number.`
