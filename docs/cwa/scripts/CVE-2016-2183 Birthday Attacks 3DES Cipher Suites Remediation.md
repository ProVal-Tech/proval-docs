## Summary

This script was created to run the detection/remediation for CVE-2016-2183 Birthday Attacks 3DES Cipher Suites Vulnerability detection and remediation based on the EDFs option selected by the agent.

## Sample Run

|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DetectionOnly                 | This collects client-EDF 'CVE Vulnerability Detection Only' data for the agent where the script is deployed. If it is 1, then the CVE-2016-2183-only detection will run and register to the dataview without remediation.                      |
| Detection-Remediation         | This collects data from client-EDF "CVE-2016-2183 Vul Detection and Remediation" for the agent where the script is deployed. If it is 1, then the CVE-2016-2183 vulnerability will be detected, if found vulnerable then attempt to remediate it and log the result to the dataview. |
| RemediationStatusCheck        | This contains a report on whether the remediation was successful or not.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| psout                         | It contains the complete output of the PowerShell execution for the CVE detection/remediation action.                                                                                                                                       |
| TicketCreation                | It contains the ticket categoryID applied on the [CWA Remote Monitor - CVE-2016-2183 Birthday Attacks 3DES Cipher Suites](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-15762067). Only the ticket will be created if the category is set.         |
