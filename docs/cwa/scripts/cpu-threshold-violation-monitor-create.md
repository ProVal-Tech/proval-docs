## Summary

This document outlines the process for creating remote monitors for CPU usage on Windows machines. The creation of these remote monitors is governed by system properties, as well as client-level, location-level, and computer-level Extra Data Fields (EDFs). These elements are further detailed within this document.

The script creates remote monitors that trigger an alert when the CPU usage on the target machine exceeds a certain upper threshold percentage and remains above a certain lower threshold percentage for a specified duration. These thresholds can be configured in the system properties, which are elaborated in the **System Properties** section of this document.

**Note of Caution**: The remote monitors created by this script utilize PowerShell for monitoring. Therefore, its functionality is not guaranteed on any computer running a version of PowerShell older than 5. Please ensure your systems are updated to at least PowerShell version 5 for optimal performance.

## Update Notice: 22 April, 2025

New client and computer level override EDFs have been introduced to override the value stored in system properties.  
Execute or debug the script against a single client, with the `Set_Environment` parameter set to `1` to create the new EDFs.

## Implementation

1. **Remove Existing Monitors**
   - Remove the existing `ProVal - Production - CPU Threshold Violation Monitor` monitor set from the groups it's already applied to.
   - Execute this SQL query from a RAWSQL monitor set to get rid of the existing monitors:  
     `Delete From Groupagents where Name = 'ProVal - Production - CPU Threshold Violation Monitor'`
   - Open the `Server Status` tool by navigating to `Help` > `Server Status`.  
     ![Server Status Tool](../../../static/img/docs/20b0f192-7315-42d9-a575-9e088c15d79c/image_1.webp)
   - Click the `Do Group Refresh` button to refresh and apply the changes made.  
     ![Do Group Refresh](../../../static/img/docs/20b0f192-7315-42d9-a575-9e088c15d79c/image_2.webp)
   - Click `OK` to the popup message and wait for a minute to allow the changes to take effect.

The lower threshold is the CPU usage percentage that stops the timer. Once the CPU usage goes below the lower threshold, the monitor set stops the timer initiated after hitting the higher threshold stored in the `CPU_Monitoring_Server_High_Threshold_Percentage` property. The monitor set will auto-close the ticket after the CPU usage for the server drops below the percentage stored in this system property. The default value is `90`. <br />![Image11](../../../static/img/docs/20b0f192-7315-42d9-a575-9e088c15d79c/image11.webp) |
| CPU_Monitoring_Workstation_Low_Threshold_Percentage | 85            | True     | This property stores the lower threshold, expressed as a percentage, for CPU usage on workstations. The lower threshold is the CPU usage percentage that stops the timer. Once the CPU usage goes below the lower threshold, the monitor set stops the timer initiated after hitting the higher threshold stored in the `CPU_Monitoring_Workstation_High_Threshold_Percentage` property. The monitor set will auto-close the ticket after the CPU usage for the workstation drops below the percentage stored in this system property.

## Remote Monitor Example

**Name:** `ProVal - Production - CPU Threshold Violation Monitor`

**Ticket Subject:** `CPU Usage High on %COMPUTERNAME% at %LOCATIONNAME%`

**Alert Message on Failure:** `This is an automated update to inform you that the high CPU utilization issue reported earlier has now been resolved. The system has detected that the CPU usage has returned to normal and the performance has improved.`

**Alert Message on Success:** `The CPU usage on the machine %COMPUTERNAME% located at %CLIENTNAME%/%LOCATIONNAME% is currently reporting high CPU usage. Please investigate the issue and take appropriate actions to address the root cause. As per the severity of the issue, it is recommended to prioritize this ticket accordingly.`

`%RESULT%`

**Sample Ticket:** The ticket illustrated here was created by setting the upper threshold value to `2` and the lower threshold value to `1`. However, it's important to note that this example is purely for demonstration purposes. It does not advocate for or encourage the creation of CPU usage tickets for machines where the CPU usage exceeds `2%`.
