## Summary

The purpose of this script is to add the [registry keys recommended by Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/kb5028407-how-to-manage-the-vulnerability-associated-with-cve-2023-32019-bd6ed35f-48b1-41f6-bd19-d2d97270f080) for [CVE-2023-32019 Remediation](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-32019) to supported Windows computers. Additionally, it provides an option to undo the changes if necessary.

**Important Note:**  
It is strongly advised not to run the script on a large number of machines simultaneously. The addition of these registry keys may have undisclosed effects on the computer. To ensure stability, it is recommended to initially execute the script on a few test machines, carefully observe their behavior, and then proceed with running the script on the remaining systems.

**Supported Operating Systems:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 11 versions 22H2 and 21H1
- Windows 10 versions 22H2, 21H2, 21H1, 20H2, 1809, and 1607

Please exercise caution and adhere to the recommended testing process before executing the script on a wider scale.
