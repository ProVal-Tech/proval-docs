## Summary

The script restarts Windows machines according to the configuration specified in the client, location, and computer-level EDFs found in the "Reboot Management" EDF section.

**Note:**  
Reboots initiated by this solution are based on the server's time zone. For example, if a computer is in the PST timezone and the Automate server is in EST, selecting 20:00 as the reboot time will restart the machine at 20:00 EST.

## Implementation

### Step 1

Import the script using the ProSync plugin.

### Step 2

Reload the System Cache by pressing Ctrl + R.

### Step 3

Run or debug the script on any client with the `Set_Environment` parameter set to `1` to generate the necessary EDFs.

### Step 4

Reload the System Cache again (Ctrl + R).

### Step 5

Verify that the EDFs exist at the client, location, and computer levels as detailed later in this document.

### Step 6

Schedule the script to execute every 15 minutes at XX:00:05. This will ensure the reboot is sent with a 14-15 minute delay.

## FAQ

**Q: How does the script determine which computers are eligible for auto reboot?**  
A: The script checks the "Enable Auto Reboot" EDF at the computer, location, and client levels. It only targets Windows machines that are not excluded by the "Do Not Auto Reboot" EDF. Additional checks are performed for Domain Controllers and Hyper-V hosts, which require the corresponding "Include_DC" or "Include_Hyper-V_Host" EDFs to be enabled.

**Q: What happens if different levels (client, location, computer) have conflicting EDF settings?**  
A: The script and SQL logic prioritize the most specific level: computer-level EDFs override location-level, which override client-level. For example, if a computer-level "Auto Reboot Time" is set, it takes precedence over location or client settings.

**Q: How is the scheduled reboot time determined?**  
A: The script uses the "Auto Reboot Time" EDF from the computer, location, or client level (in that order of precedence). The SQL query calculates the time left until the next scheduled reboot and only triggers a reboot if the current time is within 15 minutes of the scheduled time.

**Q: How does the script handle Domain Controllers and Hyper-V hosts?**  
A: By default, Domain Controllers and Hyper-V hosts are excluded from auto reboot. To include them, the "Include_DC" or "Include_Hyper-V_Host" EDFs must be enabled at the appropriate level (location or client), and the "Enable Auto Reboot" EDF must be set to "Windows" or "Windows Servers".

**Q: Can I schedule reboots for specific days of the week?**  
A: Yes. The EDFs "Reboot_Mon", "Reboot_Tue", ..., "Reboot_Sun" allow you to specify which days auto reboot should occur. The script checks these flags at the computer, location, and client levels to determine if a reboot should be scheduled for the current day.

**Q: How does precedence work for the reboot day EDFs (Reboot_Mon, Reboot_Tue, etc.)?**  
A: The script checks the reboot day EDFs in order of precedence: computer-level first, then location-level, and finally client-level. If any of the reboot day EDFs are enabled at the computer level, only those days set at the computer will be used for scheduling reboots, regardless of the settings at the location or client levels. If none are set at the computer level, the script checks the location-level EDFs, and if none are set there, it falls back to the client-level EDFs.

For example, if the client has Saturday and Wednesday enabled, but the location has Friday and Sunday enabled, then all computers in that location will be scheduled to reboot on Friday and Sunday (location-level settings take precedence over client-level).  
If a specific computer in that location has only Monday enabled, then only that computer will be scheduled to reboot on Monday, regardless of the location or client settings.

**Q: How can I track if a computer was online at the scheduled reboot time?**  
A: The "Reboot Online Status" EDF records whether the computer was online or offline at the scheduled reboot time, helping you monitor system availability during automated reboot events.

**Q: How can I enable auto reboot for a specific location without enabling it for the entire client?**  
A: Set the "Enable Auto Reboot" EDF to the desired value (such as "Windows" or "Windows Servers") at the location level, and leave it unset at the client level. This will apply the auto reboot policy only to computers within that location.

**Q: How can I enable auto reboot for an individual computer without enabling it for the client or location?**  
A: Set the "Enable Auto Reboot" EDF to enabled at the computer level. This ensures that only the selected computer will follow the auto reboot schedule.

**Q: What happens if auto reboot is disabled at any level (client, location, or computer)?**  
A: If the "Enable Auto Reboot" EDF is set to "Disabled" at the client, location, or computer level, the auto reboot feature will be turned off for that scope. Disabling at any level takes precedence and will prevent scheduled reboots for all computers within that scope, regardless of other settings.
