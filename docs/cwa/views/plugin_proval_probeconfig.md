## Purpose

The view is created to present information related to Network Probe configurations in the environment. It consolidates the information for both Generation 1 and Generation 2 probes in one place. The view is used for the data displayed in the dataview [CWM - Automate - Dataview - Probe Deployment Audit Re-Defined [View]](/docs/0d3e8cd2-8055-42bb-8559-098e60a9db42).

This view was created to bypass the word count limit of 2500 for the "SQLBody" column in the Dataviews table. The view is generated by the script, [CWM - Automate - Script - Create View "plugin_proval_probeconfig"](/docs/5bee0fdf-d4c0-4158-8d69-ba49f43b66c5).
