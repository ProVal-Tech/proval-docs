## Summary

This Monitor identifies the ESXi host servers that contain one or more snapshots older than three days.

Default Alerting contains the information of all the virtual machines and the older snapshots grouped by ESXi host. It will generate a ticket against the Network Probe of the concerned ESXi host with the information of all the snapshots older than 3 days.

This is intended to be used with the [Script - Ticket Creation - VMWare ESXi Monitoring](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10689215) as the auto-fix.
