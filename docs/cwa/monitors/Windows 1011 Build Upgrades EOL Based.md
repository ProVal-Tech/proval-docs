## Summary

This internal monitor identifies Windows 10 and Windows 11 machines that are EOL or will be EOL within the next six months. It is recommended to schedule it overnight once per day. This monitor can be set up with the 'â–³ Custom - Autofix - Initiate Windows 10/11 Build Upgrade' Alert Template.

It explicitly excludes machines with an open failure ticket generated by the [EPM - Windows Configuration - Script - Install Windows Upgrade](<../scripts/Install Windows Upgrade.md>) script.

It also excludes machines where the [EPM - Windows Configuration - Script - Install Windows Upgrade](<../scripts/Install Windows Upgrade.md>) script has been issued more than two times within the last 30 days.
