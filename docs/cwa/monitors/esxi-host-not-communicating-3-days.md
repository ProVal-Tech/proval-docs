## Summary

This monitor is intended to report any ESXi hosts in the system that have not checked in with Automate for more than 3 days. It is designed to be used with the [Script - Ticket Creation - VMware ESXi Monitoring](/docs/7fbdffc1-7472-4276-914d-1e5b845dcd3c) as the auto-fix.

**Alert Template:** â–³ Custom - Ticket Creation - ESXi Monitoring

- [Script - Ticket Creation - VMware ESXi Monitoring](/docs/7fbdffc1-7472-4276-914d-1e5b845dcd3c)
- This solution requires that the Virtualization Manager is set up and configured.

## Target

This monitor is a Global RAWSQL monitor and does not need to be assigned to a group; however, it will only alert for ESXi hosts that exist in the Virtualization Manager.
