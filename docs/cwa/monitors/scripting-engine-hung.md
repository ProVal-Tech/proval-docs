## Summary

This monitor sends an email to [alerts@provaltech.com](mailto:alerts@provaltech.com) to proactively review why the script engine hung in the client's environment. The monitor detects the number of scripts stuck in the `pendingscripts` table for longer than the specified time after their scheduled execution.

The email is sent to the address specified in the system property `"ProVal_Alerts_Email_Address,"` which is typically [alerts@provaltech.com](mailto:alerts@provaltech.com), for proactive review.

**Requirement:** `MySQL 8.0+`

## Troubleshooting

When you see a ticket like the above for any partner please follow the below troubleshooting steps.

1. Navigate to the System >> VNC / Ticket Priority >> MAX Running Scripts. Look for the "MAX Running Scripts" and ensure its value is at least 1/3 of the value of its agent count. This applies only to the environment where you have seen frequent Scripting Engine Hung issues. This is not a stated statement; rather, it is being assumed to prevent situations in the partner environment if they continuously encounter Scripting engine crash issues. Navigate to the System >> Configuration >> Dashboard >> Config >> Configuration >> Properties. Look for the property "LT_MAXRunningScripts" and ensure its value is reflected

2. Navigate to the Automation >> Monitor >> Internal Monitor
3. Right-click and select the "New Monitor"

4. Start Fresh >> Next

5. Run the query as mentioned below. Export the list to share with the consultant. Check for the top scripts whose running count is too much figure out why it has been running like that and fix it if found irrelevant. Bring the concern to the consultant with the note point and screenshots.

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(r.scriptid) AS `Count`, 
  s.ScriptName, 
  r.`Start` AS `Last Start Date`, 
  r.Priority 
FROM 
  runningscripts r 
  JOIN lt_scripts s ON s.scriptid = r.scriptid 
WHERE 
  r.Running = 0 
  AND r.`start` BETWEEN DATE(NOW() - INTERVAL 7 DAY) 
  AND DATE(NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR) 
  AND (
    r.`executed` IS NULL 
    OR r.executed = '0000-00-00 00:00:00'
  ) 
GROUP BY 
  r.scriptid 
HAVING 
  `Count` > 10 
ORDER BY 
  COUNT(r.scriptid) DESC;
```

6. Run another query. Follow steps 2-4, then run the below query. Please validate the stuck scripts and get that report exported to Excel to forward to the consultant with your feedback and review analysis reporting.

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(0) 
FROM 
  pendingscripts p 
  JOIN lt_scripts l ON p.scriptid = l.scriptid 
  JOIN computers c ON p.targetcomputerid = c.computerid 
WHERE 
  p.targetcomputerid NOT IN (
    SELECT 
      DISTINCT computerid 
    FROM 
      maintenancemodequeue 
    WHERE 
      timestart + INTERVAL `Duration` MINUTE > NOW()
  ) 
  AND p.NextRun < NOW() - INTERVAL 15 MINUTE 
  AND CASE WHEN c.lastcontact > NOW() - INTERVAL 15 MINUTE THEN l.ScriptFlags = 0 ELSE l.scriptflags = 1 END
```

7. **Only if the scripting engine appears to be hung with a lot of scripts reporting in the queue**, Restart the DB Agent service. Navigate to Help >> Server Status >> Restart Database Agent. This will remove all queued scripts and will fix the script engine hung temporarily if the script queuing issue is not fixed from the above query results.
