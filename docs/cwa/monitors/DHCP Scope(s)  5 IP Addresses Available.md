## Summary

The remote monitor retrieves information about DHCP server scopes and their corresponding IP address statistics. It filters out inactive scopes and focuses only on active ones. The monitor set then checks the number of available IP addresses within each active scope and identifies those with 5 or fewer available IP addresses.

In other words, it detects the DHCP servers having any active DHCP Scope with less than 5 IP Addresses available.

Requirement: PowerShell v5+ (Server 2016+)

The remote monitor takes into account the reserved percentage for the DHCP failover scopes, and it will not trigger an alert for the standby DHCP server.

## Ticketing

**Subject:** ` DHCP Scope(s) with Insufficient IP Addresses Detected on %computername%`

**Ticket Summary:**  

`Active DHCP scope(s) with less than 5 available IP addresses detected on %ClientName%/%ComputerName% at %LocationName%.`

`This could potentially lead to IP address allocation problems and network connectivity issues for users. Immediate action should be taken to ensure sufficient IP addresses are available within the DHCP scopes to prevent any network disruptions. Please investigate the DHCP server configuration and take the necessary steps to address this issue. Potential solutions could include expanding IP address ranges, optimizing IP address allocation, or adding additional DHCP servers.`
