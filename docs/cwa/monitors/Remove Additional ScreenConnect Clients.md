## Summary

The monitor set identifies Windows machines with additional ScreenConnect clients installed. Additional ScreenConnect clients are those not installed from the integrated instance or from whitelisted instances, which are stored in the client-level EDF `Other Permitted SC Instances`.

To activate the monitor set for a client, mark the client-level EDF `Remove Additional SC Clients`. Similarly, to exclude a location or computer from the monitor set's detection, mark the location and computer level EDFs `Exclude - Additional SC Removal` respectively.
