## Summary

This monitor looks for any device detected by the Network probe on which the Automate agent can be deployed. It checks for machines whose MAC addresses do not match any machines with existing Automate agents. It also lists the readiness status of the device, the last attempt to install the Automate agent, the number of attempts, and the last readiness check.

## Dependencies

Schedule the [CWM - Automate - Script - MySQL - Permission - Set agentdeploymentreadinesscheck Table Permissions](<../scripts/MySQL - Permission - Set agentdeploymentreadinesscheck Table Permissions.md>) script to run every 12-24 hours as a client script in the dashboard. This will provide the necessary permissions for the `agentdeploymentreadinesscheck` table for both Hosted and On-Prem Clients. Otherwise, the monitor will not provide any results.

## Implementation

The monitor can be imported normally; just make sure to schedule the [CWM - Automate - Script - MySQL - Permission - Set agentdeploymentreadinesscheck Table Permissions](<../scripts/MySQL - Permission - Set agentdeploymentreadinesscheck Table Permissions.md>) script every 12-24 hours. Otherwise, the monitor will not work.
