## Summary

The purpose of this monitor is to detect Windows machines with Duo installed on them, where the EDF `Duo Agent Exclusion` is opted at the client, location, or computer level.

**Note:** *The same EDFs are also being used in the [SWM - Software Install - DUO Install/Upgrade - Latest Version](<../scripts/DUO InstallUpgrade - Latest Version.md>). Selecting these EDFs will exclude the agent from DUO deployment and will also uninstall DUO from the machine if it is already installed.*
