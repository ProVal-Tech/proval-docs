## Summary

The monitor set generates a client-level ticket containing details of domain-joined computers active within the domain, which have been joined to the domain for at least 7 days but do not have the Automate agent installed. This data is retrieved from the `Active Directory Browser plugin`, necessitating proper installation and configuration of the plugin to facilitate this monitoring process.

Client-level EDF `Excluded Missing Agent Computers` can be used to exclude the computer(s) from monitoring. Multiple computer names should be separated by commas (without any spaces).

Example: Adding `Computer1,Computer2,Computer3` to the EDF will exclude these machines from monitoring and from being fetched in the ticket.

## Additional Notes

Execute this SQL query from a `RAWSQL` monitor set to create the `EDF` before importing the monitor set from the ProSync plugin.

```
INSERT IGNORE 
    INTO `extrafield` 
        (`Form`, `Name`, `Sort`, `NoBreak`, `FType`, `Section`, `UnEditable`, `Collapsed`, `Fill`, `LtGuid`, `IsPassword`, `IsEncrypted`, `IsHidden`, `IsRestricted`, `ViewPermissions`, `EditPermissions`) 
    VALUES 
        (3, 'Excluded Missing Agent Computers', 0, 0, 0, 'Exclusions', 0, 0, '', 'c3e5dfe9-3950-4057-a37d-1e0555ac03ed', 0, 0, 0, 0, '', '');
CALL v_extradata(3, 'Clients'); 
CALL v_ExtraDataRefresh(3, 'Clients');
