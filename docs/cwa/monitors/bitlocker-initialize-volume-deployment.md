## Summary

This internal monitor detects online supported Windows workstation operating systems (Windows 10/11) that have not been updated in the `plugin_proval_bitlocker_audit` table in the last 7 days and do not have the key protector ID and protection status set. It also checks if the location-EDF 'BitLocker Encryption Automation - Enable [Wks]' is set to either "AllDrive" or "SystemDrive" from the dropdown option, and that the computer-EDF 'BitLocker Enable Exclude' is not checked. 

The monitor ensures that the [Script - Bitlocker - Volume - Initialize [Autofix,Param] - Wrapper](/docs/85513764-8240-40fb-be86-7be910ea62cf) is run once every 7 days on the detected agents to avoid multiple reiteration attempts. It excludes agents where the script has failed to initialize the BitLocker setup 2 times, which is recorded in the script state as 'Bitlocker_Enable_Fail_Count'.
