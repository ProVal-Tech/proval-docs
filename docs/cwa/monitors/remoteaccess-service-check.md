## Summary

The purpose of the remote monitor is to set the Start type for the RemoteAccess service to `Automatic` and start it if it is stopped. This PowerShell remote monitor checks whether the RemoteAccess service is running. If it is not running, it sets the StartType to Automatic and attempts to restart the service. If the service fails to start, a ticket is created.
