## Summary

This monitor is intended to report any ESXi hosts in the system that have reported a remaining storage space of less than 10% for any disk within the VMWare monitoring. This is designed to be used with the [Script - Ticket Creation - VMWare ESXi Monitoring](<../scripts/Ticket Creation - VMWare ESXi Monitoring.md>) as the auto-fix.

**Alert Template:** â–³ Custom - Ticket Creation - ESXi Monitoring
