## Summary

The purpose of the internal monitor is to execute [EPM - Disk - Script - Crystal Disk Info Report](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-12960045) script once per week against the managed Windows machines.

**Note:** The script is supported for PowerShell V5+ only. Hence, the monitor set explicitly excludes Operating Systems older than Windows 10 or Server 2016. However, if you are certain that the PS version for Server 2012 R2 servers in your environment is updated to v5+, then '**2012 R2**' can be removed from this line in the monitor set's additional field, and it will start running the script on those servers too.
