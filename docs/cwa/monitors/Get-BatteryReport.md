## Summary

This monitor checks twice a day, targeting only computers where the last battery report scan is greater than 24 hours ago and the last battery report returned data. It runs the [EPM - Data Collection - Automate - Script Get - Battery Report](<../scripts/EPM - Data Collection - Automate - Script Get - Battery Report.md>) script.

## Dependencies

- [EPM - Data Collection - Automate - Script Get - Battery Report](<../scripts/EPM - Data Collection - Automate - Script Get - Battery Report.md>)
- [EPM - Data Collection - Custom Table - plugin_proval_batteries](<../tables/plugin_proval_batteries.md>)

## Target

The purpose of this monitor is to select all computers that have returned a valid battery report in the past or where the last scan was more than 24 hours ago. This monitor then triggers the Automate Get - Battery Report script to run on any device that meets these conditions.

## Alert Template

**Name:** `â–³ CUSTOM - Execute Script - Get-BatteryReport`

The alert template should run the [EPM - Data Collection - Automate - Script Get - Battery Report](<../scripts/EPM - Data Collection - Automate - Script Get - Battery Report.md>) script.
