## Summary

This monitor looks for any device that is detected by Network probe and on which automate agent can be deployed. It looks for machines whose MAC Address doesn't match with any machine with existing Automate agents. It also lists the Readiness status of the device and the last attempt to install the Automate agent, Number of attempts and last readiness check.

## Dependencies

Schedule the [CWM - Automate - Script - MySQL - Permission - Set agentdeploymentreadinesscheck Table Permissions](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-12944749) script to run every 12-24 hours as a client script in the dashboard. This will provide the needed permission for the `agentdeploymentreadinesscheck` Table for both Hosted as well as On-Prem Clients. Otherwise, the monitor will not provide any results.
