## Summary

Check the computer for security event log event ID 4625 where the count of occurrences is greater than 10 in the last 60 minutes.

The threshold can be modified by updating the value of the `$th` variable in the remote monitor's command. Change this value from 10 to the desired value after importing the remote monitor.

**The monitor set may not perform as expected for PowerShell versions older than 5.**

## Troubleshooting

## FAQ

#### **General Troubleshooting Steps:**

**1. Identify the Account Type:**

- `Domain Account:` Check in Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC).

- `Local Account:` Use Computer Management > Local Users and Groups.
- `Service Account:` Check services or scheduled tasks using the account.
- `Unknown Account:` Investigate for potential brute-force or enumeration attacks.  

**2. Review Event Logs:**

- Look for Event ID `4625` in the Security log.

**3. Pay attention to:**

- Status/SubStatus codes

- Logon Type

- Source IP/Workstation

- Target Account Name

#### **Error Code Specific Troubleshooting:**

| Error Code   | Meaning                          | Action Steps                                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0xC000006A   | Bad password                     | - Check if the password was recently changed.  	- Reset the password if needed.  	- Investigate repeated attempts (possible brute-force). |
| 0xC000006D   | Bad username or auth info        | - Verify username.  	- Check for typos or outdated credentials.  - Investigate source of repeated failures. |
| 0xC0000064   | Bad or misspelled username       | - Confirm the account exists.  	- Investigate for enumeration attempts.   |
| 0xC000005E   | No logon servers available       | - Check domain controller availability.  	- Ensure network connectivity.  - Restart Netlogon service. |
| 0xC000006F   | Logon outside authorized hours   | - Review account restrictions in AD.  	- Adjust allowed logon hours if needed. |
| 0xC0000070   | Unauthorized workstation         | - Check workstation restrictions in AD.  	- Update allowed workstations.  |
| 0xC0000072   | Account disabled                 | - Enable the account in AD.  	- Investigate why it was disabled.         |
| 0xC000015B   | Logon type not granted           | - Check Group Policy or Local Security Policy.  	- Grant appropriate logon rights. |
| 0xC0000192   | Netlogon service not started     | - Start the Netlogon service.  	- Set it to automatic.                   |
| 0xC0000193   | Expired account                  | - Extend or renew the account expiration date.                              |
| 0xC0000413   | Auth firewall restriction        | - Review firewall or security policies.  	- Allow the account to authenticate. |


#### **Service Account Specific Checks:**

- Find Services Using the Account:

- Run: `Get-WmiObject win32_service | Where-Object { $_.StartName -like "*accountname*" }`  
Or check manually in Services.msc.

**Update Password:**

- Change the password in AD.

- Update it in all services, scheduled tasks, and applications using it.

#### **If the Account is Unknown or Suspicious**

- `Investigate Source IP:` Use firewall logs or SIEM tools.
Check for Patterns: Repeated failures from the same IP or targeting multiple accounts.
- `Block IP or Account:` If malicious, take immediate action.
Enable Account Lockout Policies: To prevent brute-force attacks.
