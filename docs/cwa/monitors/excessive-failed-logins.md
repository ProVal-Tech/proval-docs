## Summary

Check the computer for security event log event ID 4625 where the count of occurrences is greater than 10 in the last 60 minutes.

The threshold can be modified by updating the value of the `$th` variable in the remote monitor's command. Change this value from 10 to the desired value after importing the remote monitor.

**The monitor set may not perform as expected for PowerShell versions older than 5.**
