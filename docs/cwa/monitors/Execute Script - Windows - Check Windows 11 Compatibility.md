## Summary

The purpose of this monitor set is to execute the [Windows - Check Windows 11 Compatibility](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-8355447) script. This script can either be scheduled against the group, or we can use this monitor set to execute the script.

The monitor set will execute the script only once against the machines where it had never been executed, and once per six months against the machines where the upgrade was not capable during the previous execution of the script. Additionally, if the script failed to complete successfully, it will re-attempt that check every 30 days.
