## Summary

The purpose of this monitor is to monitor if Huntress Agent has been Orphaned or not. By Orphaned it means Huntress has not received a response from the agent within 30 days and the Agent's key/token has been revoked by Huntress. At that point, the agent is unable to send or receive any data from the Huntress portal and is essentially not performing security tasks anymore.

## Details

**Suggested "Limit to"**: 'Machines with Huntress Agent'  
**Suggested Alert Style**: Continuous  
**Suggested Alert Template**: `â–³ Custom - Ticket Creation - Computer [Failures Only]`
