## Summary

The EPM - Disk - Internal Monitor - Predictive Hard Drive Failure is an internal monitor component of the solution that detects potential hard drive failures. It alerts the user about any machine where the EPM - Disk - Script - Disk - Gather Critical Data script has detected errors over the past 7 days. This monitor helps to predict potential hard drive failures and enables proactive maintenance, preventing data loss or system failure.

## Dependencies

- [EPM - Disk - Script - Disk - Gather Critical Data](<../scripts/Disk - Gather Critical Data.md>)
- [EPM - Disk - Internal Monitor - Execute Script - Disk - Gather Critical Data](<./Execute Script - Disk - Gather Critical Data.md>)
- [EPM - Disk - Custom Table - plugin_proval_cdi_data](<../tables/plugin_proval_cdi_data.md>)
- [CWM - Automate - Script - Ticket Creation - Computer](<../scripts/Ticket Creation - Computer.md>)

## Implementation

- Replace the `\<MONITORID>` in the Additional Condition with the ID of the monitor set.  
  Before:  
  ![Before](../../../static/img/Predictive-Hard-Drive-Failure/image_1.png)  
  After:  
  ![After](../../../static/img/Predictive-Hard-Drive-Failure/image_2.png)

## Target

Global as the monitor set is limited to the machines detected within the [EPM - Disk - Custom Table - plugin_proval_cdi_data](<../tables/plugin_proval_cdi_data.md>) table.

## Ticketing

**Subject:**  
`DRV - Predictive HDD failure detected on %COMPUTERNAME% at %CLIENTNAME%`

**Ticket Body on Failure:**  
`A predictive failure has been detected on this machine - %COMPUTERNAME% at %CLIENTNAME%  
Current Status - %RESULT%  
%FIELDNAME%`

**Ticket Body on Success:**  
`This computer is no longer detected as being a predictive failure.`

**%FIELDNAME%:**  
`The Drive information is outlined below:`  
```
Drive Manufacturer: \<Drive Manufacturer>
Drive Model: \<Drive Model>
Disk Size: \<Disk Size in GB>
Disk Interface: \<Disk Interface>
```
