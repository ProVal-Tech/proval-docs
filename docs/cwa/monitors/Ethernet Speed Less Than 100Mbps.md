## Summary

This monitor is designed to detect and ticket when an agent is reporting an Ethernet adapter is running at a speed less than 100Mbps. Normally customers do not have networks that are intended to run under 100Mbps, however, negotiated speeds can end up at 10Mbps due to a bad cable connection or malfunctioning phone that needs to be rebooted.
