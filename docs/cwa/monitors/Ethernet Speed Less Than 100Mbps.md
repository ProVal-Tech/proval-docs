## Summary

This monitor is designed to detect and create tickets when an agent reports that an Ethernet adapter is running at a speed less than 100 Mbps. Normally, customers do not have networks that are intended to run under 100 Mbps; however, negotiated speeds can end up at 10 Mbps due to a bad cable connection or a malfunctioning device that needs to be rebooted.

## Dependencies

There are no dependencies required for this monitor to work.

## Target

- Windows Workstations
- Windows Servers
