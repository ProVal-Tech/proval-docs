## Summary

This is the ProVal version of the default monitor "SVC - Auto Services Stopped". It has been modified to support wild cards within the service blacklist in the System Dashboard. This monitor will monitor all the services which are set to automatically start with windows and are not running except any that are mentioned in the service blacklist. To exclude any service from this monitor, add its name to the service blacklist. You could also add a wildcard to exclude all the services with that name like using the wildcard 'GoogleUpdater*' to exclude all the services with the name "GoogleUpdater".
