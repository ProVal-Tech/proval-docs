## Ticketing

**Subject:**  `HyperV - Aging Snapshot Detected on %Computername%`  

**Body:**  
```
The Hyper-V Host, %COMPUTERNAME%, has detected a VM snapshot that has an age of 3 days or older. It is important to delete unneeded snapshots since they can cause the server to use extra space over time. Please review the details below and remove the snapshot if it is no longer needed.
