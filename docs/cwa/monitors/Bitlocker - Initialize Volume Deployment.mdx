## Summary

This internal monitor detects the online supported Windows workstation OS (Windows 10/11) which is not updated in the table `plugin_proval_bitlocker_audit` in the last 7 days and does not have the keyprotectorid and protectionstatus set. It also checks if the location-EDF 'BitLocker Encryption Automation - Enable [Wks]' is set to either "AllDrive" or "SystemDrive" from the dropdown option and the computer-EDF 'BitLocker Enable Exclude' is not checked. It ensures running the [Script - Bitlocker - Volume - Initialize [Autofix,Param] - Wrapper](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-16716755) once every 7 days on the detected agents of the monitor to remove the reiterate attempts numerous times. It excludes agent where the script failed 2 times to initialize the bitlocker set up which was recorded to the script state = 'Bitlocker_Enable_Fail_Count'.
