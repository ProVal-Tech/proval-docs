## Summary

This monitor looks at the proval_plugin_certs table (Generated through the [Import SSL Certificates into CWA [Custom Table]](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775) Script) for any SSL certs that have an expiration date of fewer than 30 days. This solution is good to catch the machines that may have been missed and do not have active reminders in place for certificate renewals. Also, the difference between the certification add and expiration should be at least 30 days to get an alert.

Alert Template: â–³ Custom - Ticket Creation - Computer

## Implementation

To exclude the self-signed, Microsoft-generated, and any certificate with a GUID in Subject, uncomment the following lines in the Additional Condition. But before adding any exclusions, it is suggested to review the [EPM - Network - Dataview - SSL Certificate Audit](https://proval.itglue.com/5078775/docs/9382198) dataview to ensure that enabling these exclusions is not going to exclude any important certificate.
