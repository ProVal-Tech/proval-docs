## Summary

This monitor will look for machines with the event ID 6008. This Windows event is usually associated with an "Unexpected Shutdown".

## Dependencies

The machine must be a Windows-based device.  
Automate must be gathering event logs into the database for this internal monitor to function.

## Target

Primarily this monitor target is servers, but it will work properly for workstations if this data is of value to the MSP.  
**Servers** - Should be run on servers  
**Windows Machines** - Should be run on all Windows machines
