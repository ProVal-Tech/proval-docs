## Ticket Example

![Ticket Example](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_1.webp)

If you are reading this document, you should have received a ticket similar to the one above. This document is intended to guide you through the troubleshooting steps to resolve this problem.

### Prerequisites

Determine if the hard drive in question is an SSD or a normal spinning disk:

- You can confirm whether the hard drive is an SSD by looking at the Health Status.
- **SSD** - If there is a percentage next to the health status, that indicates the remaining life of the SSD.
  ![SSD Health Status](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_2.webp)
- **Spinning Disk** - If there is no percentage, that means it is a spinning disk.
  ![Spinning Disk Health Status](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_3.webp)

## Troubleshooting Steps:

### SSD

1. **Understanding the Flags that Crystal Disk Info is Looking For:**
   ![Crystal Disk Info Flags](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_4.webp)
   Percentage Used - Color correlation
   ![Percentage Used](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_5.webp)
   - Note that the "Bad" flag on the remaining life is completely vendor-defined. If the percentage used is flagged as red, it is recommended to replace the drive as soon as possible.
   - **The Critical Warning Flag**
     - This is vendor-controlled, and the drive should be replaced if it is flagged as 'Red'.
   (5 minutes)

2. You can run a different hard drive test, like SeaTools, on the drive to validate whether the hard drive is actually failing.
   - [SeaTools Download](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/)
   If the hard drive is not reporting issues, you can proceed to the next step. If it is reporting issues, recommend drive replacement.
   - Follow the Replacement Process linked on the left to recommend replacing the drive.
   (25 minutes)

3. Other than this, there is not much that can be done for a Solid State Drive other than replacing the drive or excluding it from monitoring using the 'Disks to Exclude from Disk Health Alerting' EDF.

   **NOTE**: Before excluding the drive from detection, it is highly recommended that this only be used as a last resort, and confirm the client is fully aware that the hard drive is failing and is willing to let it die.
   ![SSD Exclusion](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_6.webp)
   (5 minutes)

### Spinning Disk

1. **Understanding the Flags that Crystal Disk is Looking For:**
   ![Crystal Disk Spinning Disk Flags](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_7.webp)

   The key flags from spinning disks:
   - **Reallocated Sectors Count**
     - This indicates the total number of times that the hard drive has encountered an error when attempting to copy data to a specific sector of the hard drive and ultimately needed to move the data to a different spot on the hard drive. The health status is dependent on this SMART value nearly every time on a spinning disk.

   Options:
   - You can run a different hard drive test, like SeaTools, on the drive to validate whether the hard drive is actually failing.
     - [SeaTools Download](https://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/)
   - OR - Skip to the next step.
   (5 minutes)

2. If available, log in to the machine using ScreenConnect Backstage Mode:
   ![ScreenConnect](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_8.webp)
   (5 minutes)

3. Navigate to the storage location for the Crystal Disk Info application. Currently, it is stored under:
   ```
   C:/Programdata/_automation/CrystalDiskInfo/CrystalDiskInfo/DiskInfo64.exe
   ```
   But it may also be found here if the solution is not fully up to date:
   ```
   C:/CrystalDiskInfo/CrystalDiskInfo/DiskInfo64.exe
   ```
   Simply paste that line into the command prompt, and it should open Crystal Disk Info within backstage mode.

   If backstage mode was not an option, skip to the next step:
   (5 minutes)

4. Grab the HEX value of the Reallocated Sector Count stat to review how bad the drive is:
   - ![Reallocated Sector Count](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_9.webp)
   - OR from the log file:
     ![Log File 1](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_10.webp)
     ![Log File 2](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_11.webp)
       - *Note*: The above screenshot is of a different drive, which is why the values are different. This is just showing where the numbers can be found.
   - And run it through this converter: [Hex to Decimal Converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html)
     ![Hex to Decimal](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_12.webp)
   (5 minutes)

5. Based on how high the decimal value is, you will either want to replace the drive or monitor for progression:
   - For lower values, you can adjust the threshold on a per-machine basis by following the steps below:
     1. Open the Computer Management screen for the machine in question.
     2. Right-click on the gear and select 'Extra Data Fields'.
     3. Navigate to the Crystal Disk Info - HDD Test tab and enter a higher value in the 'Crystal Disk - Reallocated Sectors' EDF than what was reported as the decimal number.
        - In the above example, I would set the threshold to 150.
        ![Threshold Example](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_6.webp)
   - If the decimal value is higher than 500, I would recommend replacing the drive as soon as possible.
     - Follow the Replacement Process linked on the left to recommend replacing the drive.
   (5 minutes)

6. Then re-run the Crystal Disk Audit script on the machine to update the database with the correct information.
   ![Crystal Disk Audit 1](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_13.webp)
   ![Crystal Disk Audit 2](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_14.webp)
   (5 minutes)

## Replacement Process

1. Check to see if the PC is under warranty:
   - If WarrantyMaster/ScalePad is set up and deployed:
   ![Warranty Check](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_15.webp)
   - If this plugin is not set up, you will need to hit the 'Show Details' button in the Computer Management screen â†’ Grab the S/N of the machine and look up the warranty status manually:
   ![Manual Warranty Check](../../../static/img/docs/1462c9f3-6c6d-4703-a2f5-07a1e1d62fd9/image_16.webp)
     - For Dell Machines: [Dell Warranty Check](https://www.dell.com/support/contractservices/en-us)
     - For HP Machines: [HP Warranty Check](https://support.hp.com/us-en/check-warranty)
     - For Lenovo Machines: [Lenovo Warranty Check](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/warranty-lookup#/)

   (5 minutes)

2. If the machine is **not under warranty and is more than 5 years old**, a full PC replacement would be recommended rather than investing money into an old machine.

3. If the **machine is under warranty**, an additional drive test may be required by the manufacturer to allow the drive to be replaced under warranty.

4. If the **machine's warranty has just recently expired**, a replacement drive quote should be sent to the client for approval.
   - **NOTE**: Always recommend an SSD as the replacement. Spinning disks may be cheaper, but they are much slower and not worth the headache.
