## Summary

The dataview is designed to display the Cumulative Update compliance score for the whole environment. It displays data exclusively for the Windows computers with managed patch policies, which have been online in Automate within the past 30 days and are part of production patching groups.

The data is grouped by client.

| CU Score %                   | This scoring system is custom-made, based on the age of the installed Cumulative Update. A score of 100 is assigned if the Cumulative Update is less than 45 days old, 75 if it falls between 46 to 90 days, 50 for updates aged between 91 to 135 days, 25 for updates older than 136 days, and 0 for EOL machines. The formula used for calculation is as follows:  <br> `(CU Age - Current) * 100 + (CU Age - 46-90) * 75 + (CU Age - 91-135) * 50 + (CU Age - 136+) * 25) / Production Computers` |
