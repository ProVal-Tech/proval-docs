| AlertStyle                | This shows the monitor's alert style, which means the number of failures to trigger before alerting.0 - Continuous -> It will trigger an autofix for each failure detected.1 - Once -> It will trigger an alert for one failure and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.2 - Twice -> It will trigger an alert for two continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.3 - Thrice -> It will trigger an alert for three continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.4 - Fourth -> It will trigger an alert for the four continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.5 - Fifth -> It will trigger an alert for five continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.6 - Sixth -> It will trigger an alert for six continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.7 - Seventh -> It will trigger an alert for seven continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.8 - Eighth -> It will trigger an alert for eight continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.9 - Ninth -> It will trigger an alert for nine continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.10 - Tenth -> It will trigger an alert for ten continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again. |
| Group                     | It shows the target group where the remote monitor is applied.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Ticket Category           | It shows the ticket category name to which the ticket will be generated via the autofix alert template.                                                                                                                                         |
| Affected Computers        | It shows the number of agents where the remote monitor is applied.                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Color Coding

Color coding was applied to the columns "Monitor Nature", "Affected Computers", and "Script Nature" as shown below:

![Color Coding](../../../static/img/All-Remote-Monitor-Detailed-Report/image_1.png)

Monitor Nature: The "ProVal Monitor" is highlighted in Green to catch the eye to show the ProVal remote monitors in the environment.  
Script Nature: Here, the "ProVal Script" is highlighted in Green to catch the eye of where the "ProVal" scripts are used as an autofix.  
Affected Computers: Here, the "0" is written in bold/Italic font using Red color to show the remote monitors that are not applied to any computers.
