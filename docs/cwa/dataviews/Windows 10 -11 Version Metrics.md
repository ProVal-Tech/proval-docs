## Summary

This Dataview will display the number of Windows 10 and Windows 11 machines by the build number (ReleaseID) as well as a calculated percentage of machines on that version against the total number of Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices. There are several filters available for this data.

An additional summarized row per Windows version is included, e.g., Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows 11 + 10. Please see below for reference:

There are three summarized rows in this Dataview: one for all Windows 10, one for all Windows 11, and the final one for the combined number of Windows 10 and Windows 11 in the environment. The red row indicates that this ReleaseID is no longer supported by Microsoft.
