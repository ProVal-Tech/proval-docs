## FAQs

**Q: Applying the filter is taking forever?**  
**A:** It's because dataview is so complex and most likely because of the amount of data it is processing. There is no better way to overcome that, however, [CWM - Automate - Script - Dataview - Email as CSV [Param]](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-8856158) script can be used to Email out the dataview and apply the filters in the csv rather than in the dataview.  

Step 1: Find the ID of the `Windows Patching - Quick Audit (Reference Table)` dataview.
