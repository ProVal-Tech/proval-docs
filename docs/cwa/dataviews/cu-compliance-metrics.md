| CU Score %                     | This scoring system is custom-made, based on the age of the installed Cumulative Update. A score of 100 is assigned if the Cumulative Update is less than 45 days old, 75 if it falls between 46 and 90 days, 50 for updates aged between 91 and 135 days, 25 for updates older than 136 days, and 0 for EOL machines. The formula used for calculation is as follows: `(CU Age - Current) * 100 + (CU Age - 46-90) * 75 + (CU Age - 91-135) * 50 + (CU Age - 136+) * 25) / Production Computers` |

| Validation                       | This is a hidden column that displays the concatenated data for the entire environment in the following format: `Total Wks: X | Total Svrs: X | Wks Online > 30d: X | Online Patch Managed Wks: X | Patch Managed Wks: X | Patch Managed Svrs: X | Wks in CU Table: X | Svrs in CU Table: X | Unsupported Svrs: X | Unsupported Wks: X` **Total Wks** - Total number of workstations unfiltered. **Total Svrs** - Total number of servers unfiltered. **Wks Online > 30d** - Workstations that have been online in the past 30 days, including non-patch-managed and EOL systems. **Online Patch Managed Wks** - Workstations that have been online in the past 30 days and are patch-managed, including EOL systems. **Patch Managed Wks** - Workstations that are patch-managed, including offline agents and EOL systems. **Patch Managed Svrs** - Servers that are patch-managed, including offline agents and EOL systems. **Wks in CU Table** - Workstations that are in the [pvl_win_latest_installed_cu](/docs/c03e4def-7efe-4a8b-99e9-d99ac2c65f5a) table. **Svrs in CU Table** - Servers that are in the [pvl_win_latest_installed_cu](/docs/c03e4def-7efe-4a8b-99e9-d99ac2c65f5a) table. **Unsupported Svrs** - Servers that are EOL. **Unsupported Wks** - Workstations that are EOL. This column is independent of the [pvl_cu_compliance](/docs/fbd4b655-562a-4ff1-aea7-be27b9a77421) table and displays the count of all machines regardless of whether they are supported or end of life. |
