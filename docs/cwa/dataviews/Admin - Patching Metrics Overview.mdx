## Summary

Present the fundamental patching-related statistics for the patch-managed windows computers present in the environment. Data is displayed w.r.t the `Approval age` of the patches. It will show five rows, i.e., one row per Approval age category.

The approval age is divided into five categories:

- Less than 7 Days (\<= 7)
- Between 8 to 14 Days (8-14)
- Between 15 to 21 Days (15-21)
- Between 22 to 30 Days (22-30)
- More than 30 Days (> 30)

The SQL query filters the results for the Patch Managed computers only, removing the `j.Patching Policy = 'Managed'` from the `SQLWhere` dataview will also show the data for the Unmanaged windows machines.
