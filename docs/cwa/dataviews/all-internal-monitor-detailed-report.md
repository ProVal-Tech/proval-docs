![Color Coding](../../../static/img/All-Internal-Monitor-Detailed-Report/image_1.png)

- **Monitor Nature**: The "ProVal Monitor" is highlighted in green to distinguish ProVal internal monitors from others.
- **Monitor Status**: The "Disabled" font is bold/italic and highlighted in red to draw attention to disabled monitors.
- **Script Nature**: The "ProVal Script" is highlighted in green to indicate where "ProVal" scripts are used as autofixes.
- **Synced/Updated**: "Yes" is highlighted in green, "No" in red, and "N/A" in grey to easily indicate whether the monitor is properly synced/updated from the ProVal plugin.
