## Summary

This dataview shows all custom remote monitors built by ProVal with its detailed implementation status information.

## Columns

| Column                | Description                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monitor              | Remote monitor name                                                                                                             |
| Interval             | It shows the frequency of the monitor execution in the second format.                                                           |
| Interval String      | It shows the frequency of the monitor execution in Days, Hours, and Minutes format.                                            |
| AlertStyle           | This shows the monitor's alert style, which means the number of failures to trigger before alerting.0 - Continuous -> It will trigger an autofix for each failure detected.1 - Once -> It will trigger an alert for one failure and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.2 - Twice -> It will trigger an alert for two continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.3 - Thrice -> It will trigger an alert for three continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.4 - Fourth -> It will trigger an alert for the four continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.5 - Fifth -> It will trigger an alert for five continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.6 - Sixth -> It will trigger an alert for six continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.7 - Seventh -> It will trigger an alert for seven continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.8 - Eighth -> It will trigger an alert for eight continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.9 - Ninth -> It will trigger an alert for nine continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again.10 - Tenth -> It will trigger an alert for ten continuous failures and wait for the success to report to re-trigger the autofix again. |
| Group                | It shows the target group where the remote monitor is applied.                                                                   |
| Alert Template       | It contains the alert template applied to the monitor.                                                                          |
| Alert Template Description | It shows detailed information on the alert template if provided during the creation.                                     |
| Script               | It shows the script that is running as an autofix with the monitor via an alert template applied to it.                         |
| Script Nature        | It shows whether the script used as an autofix is the ProVal script or a default script.                                       |
| Ticket Category      | It shows the ticket category name to which the ticket will be generated via the autofix alert template.                         |
| Affected Computers   | It shows the number of agents where the remote monitor is applied.                                                              |

## Color coding

Color coding was applied to the columns "Affected Computers" and "Script Nature" as shown below:

![Color Coding](../../../static/img/ProVal-Remote-Monitor-Detailed-Report/image_1.png)

Script Nature: Here, the "ProVal Script" is highlighted in Green to catch the eye of where the "ProVal" scripts are used as an autofix.  
Affected Computers: Here, the "0" is written in bold/italic font using Red color to show the remote monitors that are not applied to any computers.
