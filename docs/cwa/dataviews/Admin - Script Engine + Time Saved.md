## Summary

This dataview will display metrics on how scripts are running in the environment. This dataview will also include metrics around the time saved by automation.

## Columns

| Column                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ScriptName                               | The name of the script                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| MachineHours                             | This is a calculated metric that will tally, in hours, how many times each script is executed. More hours indicate the script is running more often. This value is a lifetime total for the script in the environment.                                   |
| LastRunTime                              | The amount of time, in minutes, it took the script to run that last time it ran.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Avg Run Time                             | The number of days each script has been running in the environment.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| TotalRuns                                | The count of times each script has run. This is a lifetime total for the script in the environment.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Avg Runs per day - All Time             | This is a calculated column that takes the total number of times the script has been run and divides it by how long the script has been running in the environment. This gives an idea of how many times the script runs per day as long as the script has been run. |
| LastRunDate                              | The most recent time the script was run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Recent Script Count                      | This is the number of times the script has run based on the retention setting for script logs. Typically this is 30-90 days.                                                                                                                                 |
| MachinesEffected                         | This is the number of distinct devices that have executed the script based on the retention setting for the script logs.                                                                                                                                   |
| Recent Days Running                      | This is a check that indicates the oldest script execution based on the script retention settings. (Note: this column is mostly for validation purposes.)                                                                                                     |
| Avg runs per day                        | This is the number of times the script was executed recently divided by the recent days running. This metric can be compared with the average runs per day - all data metrics to see if the script is running more or less recently.                       |
| Script Automation Time                   | This portion of the dataview reviews the "Automation Time Saved" value included in automate scripts. If that value is filled out, it will indicate how much time is saved by automation for that specific script. If the value is blank or 0, the query will substitute 1 minute for the null or 10 value. This allows for the time saved by automation values to work as expected. This default time saved by automation value can be adjusted at the request of the MSP. |
| Total Time Saved                         | This is a duration column that takes the total times the script has been executed multiplied by the automation time saved. This is then converted into Days, Hours, Minutes, and seconds. **NOTE!** There is a maximum value allowed in MySQL for the function that calculates duration. The max time is 34 Days, 22 Hours, 29 Minutes, and 59 seconds. Anything above that will not display. |
| Recent Time Saved                        | This is a duration column that takes the recent times the script has been executed multiplied by the automation time saved. This is then converted into Days, Hours, Minutes, and seconds. **NOTE!** There is a maximum value allowed in MySQL for the function that calculates duration. The max time is 34 Days, 22 Hours, 29 Minutes, and 59 seconds. Anything above that will not display. |
| Avg Daily Time Saved                     | This is a duration column that takes the average times the script has been executed per day multiplied by the automation time saved. This is then converted into Days, Hours, Minutes, and seconds. **NOTE!** There is a maximum value allowed in MySQL for the function that calculates duration. The max time is 34 Days, 22 Hours, 29 Minutes, and 59 seconds. Anything above that will not display. |
| Total Automation Time Minutes (Hidden by default) | This is the total time in minutes not converted to a duration column. This provided for validation and easy manipulation of the data.                                                                                                                      |
| Recent Automation Time Minutes (Hidden by default) | This is the most recent time in minutes not converted to a duration column. This provided for validation and easy manipulation of the data.                                                                                                                  |
| Average Daily Time Minutes               | This is the average time per day, in minutes, and is not converted to a duration column. This provided for validation and easy manipulation of the data.                                                                                                   |
