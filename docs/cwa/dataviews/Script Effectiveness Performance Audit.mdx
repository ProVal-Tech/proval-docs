| Calculated since Days    | Retention Period. The retention period for the script may vary between client scripts and computer scripts, as illustrated in the screenshot provided in the 'Summary' section. For computer scripts, calculations are based on data from the 'h_Script' table. However, the 'h_Scripts' table is utilized for client scripts, as the 'h_Script' table does not contain the required historical data for client scripts. |
| Last Run Date            | The most recent execution date of the script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Total Run                | The total number of script executions within the number of days displayed in the `Calculated since Days` column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Success Count            | Total number of times the script succeeded within the number of days displayed in the `Calculated since Days` column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Failure Count            | Total number of times the script failed or killed within the number of days displayed in the `Calculated since Days` column.

| Script Performance        | Performance of the script over the retention period. Good: `Effective Percent` is greater than or equal to 75. Bad: `Effective Percent` is less than 75. Not Run Yet: Haven't executed even once within the number of days displayed in the `Calculated since Days` column.                                                                                                   |
