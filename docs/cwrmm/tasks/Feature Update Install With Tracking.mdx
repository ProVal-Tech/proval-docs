## Summary

The script initiates the latest Feature Update using the Upgrade Assistant and records the attempt in the custom field `WinFeatUpgradeAttempts`. In case of failure, it updates the `Feature Update Install Failure` custom field with the error message. If the upgrade completes without error but a reboot is pending, the `Feature Update Reboot Pending` Custom Field is updated.

The script compares the current operating system build with the latest available build before and after the upgrade, with the latest build requiring manual entry into the script. For any new releases, the build number must be manually set in the script at step 2 for Windows 11 and step 3 for Windows 10.

- **Reboot** - If True: Will reboot the device immediately after the upgrade completes.
- **Reset** - If True: Will reset tracker counter to 0.
