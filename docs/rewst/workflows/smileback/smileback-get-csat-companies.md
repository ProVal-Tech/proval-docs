# Summary
This workflow is designed to retrieve CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) companies from SmileBack, a customer feedback platform. It automates the process of fetching company data associated with CSAT surveys using the SmileBack API, allowing users to easily access and analyze company information.

# Usage
The workflow requires an API token to authenticate requests to the SmileBack API. This is done using the [SmileBack - Get Token](/docs/4a926fc2-c329-4873-988d-6d3206add240) workflow which is run as a sub-workflow.

# Returned Data
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      
    }
  ]
}
