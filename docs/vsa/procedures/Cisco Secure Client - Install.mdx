# Overview
Installs the Cisco Secure client and selected modules.

# Requirements
For a complete installation or Umbrella installation, the OrgID, UserID, and Fingerprint are required to generate the Umbrella JSON.

# Process
There are a few configurations required for this agent procedure.

This procedure can use a URL or managed files for the installer. If using managed files, ensure line 7 is not disabled, has the location of the ZIP file, and the destination shows **#directory#//CiscoSecureClient.zip**.

If using a URL, enter in the URL on line 8.

If Umbrella is required, the organizationID, fingerprint, and userID are required. These values can be pulled from the client portal, or from the JSON file itself. Enter these values into the variables on lines 10, 11, and 13 and ensure the line is not disabled. If there are multiple sites/orgIDs, these variables can be filled with managed variables.

> Due to a bug within VSA, a variable cannot contain "OrgID" so "Organization" is used on line 13 instead. This results in a difference between the PowerShell command and the variable. -OrgId #Organization#

Line 14 is where the configuration is set for which modules are installed. Several examples are shown below in payload usage. These examples are what would be used in line 14. The full list of accepted parameters can be found in the parameters portion of this document.

# Payload Usage
```
#ScriptName#.ps1 -Source #Source# -Dart -Nvm -Posture
```
Will install the Diagnostics and Reporting, VPN Posture (HostScan), and Network Visibility Modules.

```
#ScriptName#.ps1 -Source #Source# -core -Umbrella -Dart -Nvm -UserID #UserID# -Fingerprint #Fingerprint# -OrgId #Organization#
```
Will install the Core VPN module (keeping it hidden from the end-user), Umbrella, Diagnostics and Reporting, and Network Visibility Modules. Because Umbrella is being installed, the UserID, Fingerprint, and OrgId are required.

```
#ScriptName#.ps1 -Source #Source# -core -ShowVPN -Umbrella -Dart -Nvm -UserID #UserID# -Fingerprint #FingerPrint# -OrgId #Organization#
```
Will install the Core VPN module (Visible to the end-user in the system tray icon), Umbrella, Diagnostics and Reporting, and Network Visibility Modules using the local path. Because Umbrella is being installed, the UserID, Fingerprint, and OrgId are required.

```
#ScriptName#.ps1 -Source #Source# -All -UserID #UserID# -Fingerprint #FingerPrint# -OrgId #Organization#
```
This will install all Modules, including Umbrella, which require the UserID, Fingerprint, and OrgId to be provided. Programmatically creates a JSON authentication file for access by the Umbrella module.
