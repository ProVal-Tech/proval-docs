# Overview

This agent procedure automates the installation and configuration of Google Credential Provider for Windows (GCPW). The procedure sets the domains allowed to login, and optionally configures an enrollment token. Enrollment tokens are in the Google Admin console under: Menu > Devices > Mobile and endpoints > Settings > Windows settings.

## Requirements

- PowerShell v5 or higher
- Administrative privileges are required for execution (Procedure is ran as System)

## Process

1. Checks if Google Chrome is installed. If not, it installs Google Chrome.
2. Checks if GCPW is installed. If not, it installs GCPW.
3. Sets the allowed domains for GCPW login by updating the registry.
4. Optionally sets the enrollment token for GCPW by updating the registry.
5. Performs verification steps to ensure the registry keys for domains and the enrollment token (if provided) are correctly set.
6. Cleans up installation files and logs the installation process.
