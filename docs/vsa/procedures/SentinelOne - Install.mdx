The ZIP can contain multiple images.  
The following images are supported: ('jpeg', 'jpg', 'png', 'bmp')

If the file selected is "[background.zip](http://background.zip)", no further changes are required.  
If a different file has been specified, update the filename in the PowerShell execution.  
Modify **[background.zip](http://background.zip)** to the name of the ZIP you've selected in the previous step.
