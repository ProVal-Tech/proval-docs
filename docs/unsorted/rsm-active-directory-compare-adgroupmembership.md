## Overview

This script returns information about membership changes to a group based on previous runs.

## Requirements

- Should be run on an Active Directory Domain Controller.

## Process

1. If the script has not been run previously for the target group, it creates the pertinent registry key and value, then exits.
2. Previous runs of the script are compared with the current run.
3. If changes are detected, they will be logged and added to the return object.
4. The list of users in the registry is updated with the live user list.
5. The object is returned.
