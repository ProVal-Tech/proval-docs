## Overview

Returns information about membership changes to a group based on previous runs of the script.

## Requirements

1. Should be run on an Active Directory Domain Controller

## Process

1. If the script has not been run previously for the target group, then the script creates the pertinent registry key and value, and then exits.
2. Previous runs of the script are then compared with the current run.
3. If there are changes detected, the changes will be logged and added to the return object.
4. Update the list of users in the registry with the live user list.
5. Return the object.
