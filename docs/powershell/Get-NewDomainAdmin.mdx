## Description
Gets domain users that have been granted elevated permissions since the last run of the script.

## Requirements
- Run as administrator
- PowerShell v5

If the script has not been run previously, then the admin data is saved to the table and the script exits. If a new domain admin is detected from a previous run, then it returns the newly elevated users (if any).

```powershell
.\Get-NewDomainAdmin.ps1
```

## Output

## Log Files
    .\Get-NewDomainAdmin-log.txt
    
## Tables
    Get-NewDomainAdmin_log
    Get-NewDomainAdmin_admins
