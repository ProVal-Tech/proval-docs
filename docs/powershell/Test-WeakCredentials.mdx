## Description
Agnostic method of gathering information on users with potentially compromised passwords by querying currently available comprehensive lists of known password hashes.

## Requirements
- PowerShell v5
- Must be run against an Active Directory domain controller.

## Usage
1. Download 7zip if needed.
2. Install the DSInternals module.
3. Download the Selected password list.
4. Extract and rename extracted file if necessary.
5. Get weak passwords and duplicate passwords.
6. Query For reversible encryption and interactive logon message.
7. Format the results into one object
8. Clean up the requested files.
9. Log the results.
10. Return the created object.



Downloads the 140MB password dictionary and queries that dictionary for matching hashes found on a DC and leaves all files
```powershell
.\Test-WeakCredentials -PWDictSize "Small"
```
This will download the 9mb password list, execute on the query to compare values, then it will delete the extracted txt file and the zipped file.
```powershell
.\Test-WeakCredentials -PWDictSize "Tiny" -Cleanup "text,zipped"
```
This will download the 12GB password list, execute on that query to compare values, then it will delete the txt, 7z, 7zip, and the created .xml files.
```powershell
.\Test-WeakCredentials -PWDictSize "Large" -Cleanup "All"
```
