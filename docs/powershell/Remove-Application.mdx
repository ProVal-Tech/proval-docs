| `SystemComponentOverride`  | Override   | False  |        | Switch    | The default action of this script is to not remove any item that holds the SystemComponent registry key at a value of 1, using SystemComponentOverride you can bypass that default and remove items classified as system components. |
| 'Switch'          |       | False     |           | String[]  | Specifies the custom switch(s) to be used during the uninstall process. This parameter is useful when the default silent switches do not work for a specific application. |
| 'Force'           |       | False     |           | Switch    | Forces the removal of the application using an aggressive approach if the normal uninstallation methods fail. |
