## Description
This script allows a technician to run the PowerShell equivalent of chkdsk on any or all drives, with the option to repair any found issues.

## Usage
1. If no drive letters are provided, get all drive letters.
2. Determine the scope:
    1. **No Repair option** - Runs `Repair-Volume` on that drive with the `-Scan` switch.  
        To prevent disrupting a volumeâ€™s availability, you can scan a volume without attempting to repair it. All detected corruptions are added to the `$corrupt` system file. This is equivalent to running `chkdsk /scan`.
    2. **Repair - non-full** - Runs `Repair-Volume` on that drive with the `-SpotFix` switch.  
        This option will temporarily take the volume offline for the time needed to fix those identified errors. This is equivalent to running `chkdsk /spotfix`.
    3. **Repair - Full** - Runs `Repair-Volume` on that drive with the `-OfflineScanAndFix` switch.  
        This option will take the volume offline in order to perform a full scan and fix any errors found along the way. This requires the most time but is also the most comprehensive. This is equivalent to running `chkdsk /f`.
3. Return the results of running the command.

```powershell
.\Invoke-RepairVolume.ps1
```
Returns the state of all internal drives' health and adds any corruptions to the `$Corrupt` system file.

```powershell
.\Invoke-RepairVolume.ps1 -DriveLetter C
```
Returns the state of the C drive's health.

```powershell
.\Invoke-RepairVolume.ps1 -DriveLetter C -Repair
```
Will attempt to repair any found issues on the C drive, stopping the C drive only when necessary.

```powershell
.\Invoke-RepairVolume.ps1 -Repair -Full
```
Will attempt to repair any found issues on all drives; this will render the hard drive offline during the process.
