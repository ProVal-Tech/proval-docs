## Purpose

The objective of this solution is to restore the functionality of the ConnectWise Automate agents that may be experiencing problems such as being broken or frozen. The solution comprises various components that work together to automatically identify and fix these issues. In cases where an agent is deemed beyond repair, the solution generates a report to notify the concerned parties.

It is essential to note that this solution is reliant on the CW RMM+ plugin and its proper configuration. The plugin acts as the backbone of the solution, providing the necessary functionality for automated remediation and reporting. As such, it is vital to ensure that the CW RMM+ plugin is correctly installed and configured to enable the smooth operation of the solution. Any misconfiguration or issues with the plugin may result in the failure of the solution to operate as intended, leading to delays or inefficiencies in the restoration of ConnectWise Automate agents.
