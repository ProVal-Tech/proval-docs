## Purpose

This solution provides centralized management of Windows Firewall settings across organizational devices. It enables automated disabling of Windows Firewall on targeted devices while maintaining flexibility through multi-level custom field configuration. The solution includes comprehensive monitoring, remediation capabilities, and manual override options for complete firewall management control.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Create the Custom Field

Create the [cPVAL Turn off Windows Firewall](/docs/48a340ed-d4aa-4949-9862-89e0737c5c95) custom field under `SETTINGS â†’ Custom Fields` with the following configuration:

- **Definition Scope:** Organization, Location, Device
- **Type:** Dropdown
- **Options:** None, Windows Workstation and Windows Server, Windows Workstation, Windows Server
- **Default Value:** (Empty)
- **Tab Name:** Device Standards

### Step 2: Import Automation Scripts

Import the required automation scripts:

1. **[Get Windows Firewall Status](/docs/835251c6-1c07-4e24-9806-6071107fa8d3)** - Detection script that monitors firewall state
2. **[Disable Windows Firewall](/docs/f13721f2-1a61-4ae8-bec3-1e008927dfac)** - Remediation script that turns off firewall protection
3. **[Enable Windows Firewall](/docs/e3232f95-af1e-4c98-8fe4-5f09e77c6635)** - Manual reversal script for restoring firewall functionality

### Step 3: Configure Compound Conditions

Create two compound conditions targeting the appropriate device policies:

**For Windows Workstations:**

- **Name:** [Turn off Windows Firewall Windows Workstation](/docs/cd5cfdc6-69b2-41bd-be00-3e00547f284b)
- **Policy:** `Windows Workstation [Default]`
- **Logic:** Runs when Windows Firewall is enabled AND custom field specifies Workstation inclusion

**For Windows Servers:**

- **Name:** [Turn off Windows Firewall Windows Server](/docs/d43b6332-798c-43ea-b9e2-d774a1cd04e9)
- **Policy:** `Windows Server [Default]`
- **Logic:** Runs when Windows Firewall is enabled AND custom field specifies Server inclusion

### Step 4: Set Organizational Default

Configure the organizational-level custom field to establish default behavior:

- Set to appropriate value based on organizational security policies
- Use location and device-level settings for granular exceptions and overrides

## FAQ

**Q: What happens if I need to exclude specific devices from firewall disablement?**  
A: Set the device-level custom field to "None" for any devices that should retain Windows Firewall protection.

**Q: How does the solution handle different organizational units?**  
A: The custom field supports three levels of configuration - Organization, Location, and Device - allowing for tailored firewall policies across the enterprise.

**Q: What if disabling Windows Firewall causes security concerns?**  
A: Use the [Enable Windows Firewall](/docs/e3232f95-af1e-4c98-8fe4-5f09e77c6635) script to manually restore firewall protection on any device.

**Q: How often does the solution check firewall status?**  
A: The compound conditions run continuously, monitoring Windows Firewall state and applying remediation when needed.

**Q: Can I disable firewall for workstations but not servers?**  
A: Yes, set the custom field to "Windows Workstation" only at the desired configuration level.

**Q: Does this affect all firewall profiles?**  
A: Yes, the solution manages all Windows Firewall profiles (Domain, Private, and Public) simultaneously.

**Important Security Note:** Disabling Windows Firewall reduces network security protection. Only implement this solution in environments where alternative security measures (such as network-level firewalls) are in place. Always test thoroughly before widespread deployment and maintain the ability to quickly re-enable protection if needed.
