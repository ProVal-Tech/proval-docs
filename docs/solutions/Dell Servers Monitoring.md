2. Import the `△ Custom - Ticket Creation - Computer` alert template from the `ProSync` plugin.

3. Implement the [Remote Monitor - Dell Hardware Monitoring](<../cwa/monitors/Dell Hardware Monitoring.md>) remote monitor by following the implementation steps:
   - [Implement - Remote Monitor - Dell Hardware Monitoring](<../cwa/monitors/Dell Hardware Monitoring.md>)
     - Set the alert template to `△ Custom - Ticket Creation - Computer`.

4. Reload the System Cache.
