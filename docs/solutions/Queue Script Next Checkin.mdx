1. *How does this work?*
   1. [CWM - Automate - Script - Queue Script](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606199) 
      1. If you run [CWM - Automate - Script - Queue Script](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606199) on an online machine the Script will schedule the desired script to run now.
      2. The script, [CWM - Automate - Script - Queue Script](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606199), Creates the custom table, [CWM - Automate - Custom Table - plugin_proval_queued_scripts](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606190), if it does not exist, when running on an offline machine.
      3. The script, [CWM - Automate - Script - Queue Script](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606199), Creates the 'Machines With Queued Scripts' Group if it does not exist and assigns an internal monitor to that group if it's not already assigned. This monitor will check for a recent check-in from the agent; if a recent check-in has been found then the monitor autofix will run [CWM - Automate - Script - Run Queued Scripts](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606200).
      4. The script, [CWM - Automate - Script - Queue Script](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606199), then adds the target computer to that group if the computer is not already a member.
      5. After the computer is verified to be a member of the group, the script, [CWM - Automate - Script - Queue Script](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606199), will then populate the custom table, [CWM - Automate - Custom Table - plugin_proval_queued_scripts](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606190), with the requested script and parameters, **if that computer does not already have that script scheduled.**
   
2. 'Machines With Queued Scripts' Group
   1. The group, 'Machines With Queued Scripts', holds all computers that have any queued scripts using this solution.
   2. This group's intention is to ensure that only computers with queued scripts are targeted with the [CWM - Automate - Script - Run Queued Scripts](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606200) script.

4. [CWM - Automate - Script - Run Queued Scripts](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606200) 
   1. The script, [CWM - Automate - Script - Run Queued Scripts](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606200), is executed from an internal monitor's alert action 'Monitor~~Autofix - Run Queued Scripts'.
   2. This script will execute any script(s) found in [CWM - Automate - Custom Table - plugin_proval_queued_scripts](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606190) for the target machine with its associated desired parameters either silently or with natural logging.

   4. This script will remove the computer from the group 'Machines With Queued Scripts' at the completion of the script.

5. *I have scheduled a script on a target machine, and I want to schedule that same script again, Can I?*  
   Unfortunately, no, the system safeguards against duplicate entries in the [CWM - Automate - Custom Table - plugin_proval_queued_scripts](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606190) table and will not allow a target to schedule the same script on the same computer twice at next check-in.

6. *I have been running this and I am noticing that my scripting engine is suffering, what can I do?*  
   A silent parameter is present in the [CWM - Automate - Script - Run Queued Scripts](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606200) script, modify the [CWM - Automate - Script - Run Queued Scripts](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606200) script, setting the script's global silent switch to 'Yes' this will transfer the running of the queued scripts from the script engine to simply being called directly from the [CWM - Automate - Script - Run Queued Scripts](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606200) script. Keep in mind this means that your queued scripts will not show up in the script history or on the computer's scripts page and all logging for any script called in this manner will be displayed under the [CWM - Automate - Script - Run Queued Scripts](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-10606200) log on the computer's script page.
