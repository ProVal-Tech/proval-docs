## Implementation

1. Import the Automation [DFS Replication Health Check](/docs/6ef623c1-b1aa-4019-9f1e-70ca04694a56).
2. Create CW Manage [Ticket Template](/docs/6e35ca8b-0400-40ec-b33b-d5f642979258). Also Check with partner regarding the ticketing Boards and Priority.
3. Create Compound Condition [DFS Replication Health Check](/docs/0fab1e4b-7bbb-4939-87e1-792cdcea49e4)
    

## FAQ

**Q1: What does this DFS Replication monitoring solution do?**  
A: It monitors DFS Replication servers for errors and warnings, checks replication states, and alerts when potential replication issues are detected to prevent data inconsistencies.

**Q2: Which servers is this solution applicable to?**  
A: This solution should be deployed on servers with the DFS Replication role installed (FS-DFS-Replication). It is not intended for machines without DFSR.

**Q3: How often does the monitoring script run?**  
A: The script can be scheduled based on your environmentâ€™s requirements. In our default configuration, it checks for errors and replication state in the last 1 hour.

**Q4: What kind of alerts are generated?**  
A: Alerts are triggered if any DFS Replication errors or warnings are detected or if the replication state shows issues. The alert is marked Major because replication failures can cause data inconsistencies.

**Q5: Can this solution detect all DFS replication issues?**  
A: It detects errors and warnings logged in the DFS Replication event log and checks the replication state, but does not fix replication issues automatically. Manual intervention or additional troubleshooting may be required.
