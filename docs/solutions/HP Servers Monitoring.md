## Purpose

The purpose of this solution is to monitor the hardware alerts generated on HP servers. The tools included are `HPEiLO` and `HPE Insight Management Agents`.

## Implementation

1. Import the [Monitor - Missing Vendor Admin Software](<../cwa/monitors/Missing Dell OpenManage Software.md>) internal monitor from the `ProSync` plugin.

2. Import the [Script - Deploy HP Insight Management Agent](<../cwa/scripts/Deploy HP Insight Management Agent.md>) script from the `ProSync` plugin.

3. Import the `△ Custom - Ticket Creation - Computer` alert template from the `ProSync` plugin.

4. Implement the [Remote Monitor - HP Hardware Monitoring](<../cwa/monitors/EPM - Vendor Specific - Remote Monitor - HP Hardware Monitoring.md>) remote monitor by following the implementation steps:
   - [Implement - Remote Monitor - HP Hardware Monitoring](<../cwa/monitors/Implement - Remote Monitor - HP Hardware Monitoring.md>)
     - Set the alert template of the monitor to `△ Custom - Ticket Creation - Computer`

5. Reload the System Cache.
   ![Reload the System Cache](../../static/img/HP-Servers-Monitoring/image_1.png)

6. Configure the solution as follows: 
   - Navigate to Automation → Monitors within the CWA Control Center and set up the following:
     - [Monitor - Missing Vendor Admin Software](<../cwa/monitors/Missing Dell OpenManage Software.md>)
       - **IMPORTANT:** View the results of the monitor before enabling. If there are more than 20 results, confirm with the consultant if they would like it enabled.
         - Configure with the alert template: `△ Custom - Ticket Creation - Computer`
         - Right-click and Run Now to start the monitor

### Optional Content

1. Implement the [HP iLO Health Check](<./HP iLO Health Check.md>) solution by following the implementation steps provided in the [Solution](<./HP iLO Health Check.md>) document.
   - Implement this content **only if requested** by the consultant.

## Deprecation Process

1. Remove this content from the environment: 
   1. [Script - Deploy HP Insight Management Agent](<../cwa/scripts/Deploy HP Insight Management Agent.md>)
      - You should be able to sync the deprecated content from the plugin if that is easier.
   2. Run the following SQL to remove the [Remote Monitor - HP Hardware Monitoring](<../cwa/monitors/EPM - Vendor Specific - Remote Monitor - HP Hardware Monitoring.md>). This should be run through a RAWSQL monitor.
      ```sql
      DELETE FROM groupagents WHERE `Name` = 'ProVal - Production - HP Hardware Monitoring';
      DELETE FROM agents WHERE `Name` = 'ProVal - Production - HP Hardware Monitoring' AND computerid > 0;
      ```
