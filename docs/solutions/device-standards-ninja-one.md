## FAQ

**Q: Why should we implement device standards across our organization?**  
A: Device standards ensure consistency, improve security, reduce support overhead, and provide a predictable user experience. Standardized configurations make troubleshooting easier and help maintain compliance with organizational policies.

**Q: How do we decide which solutions to implement?**  
A: Start by assessing your organizational needs. Consider factors like security requirements, user productivity needs, compliance mandates, and existing IT policies. Implement solutions that address your specific pain points and align with your overall IT strategy.

**Q: Can we customize these solutions to meet our specific requirements?**  
A: Yes, each solution offers granular control through custom fields that can be configured at organization, location, or device levels. This allows for tailored policies while maintaining overall standardization.

**Q: How do these solutions handle exceptions for specific devices or departments?**  
A: The custom field configuration allows for exceptions at multiple levels. You can set organization-wide defaults, then override them for specific locations or individual devices as needed.

**Q: What's the difference between implementing these solutions individually vs. as a package?**  
A: While each solution works independently, implementing them as a package provides comprehensive device standardization. The integrated approach ensures consistent management patterns and reduces configuration conflicts.

**Q: How often should we review and update our device standards?**  
A: Regular reviews are recommendedâ€”typically quarterly or whenever there are significant changes in organizational requirements, security threats, or software updates.

**Q: What happens if a solution causes unexpected issues on some devices?**  
A: Each solution includes reversal scripts and the ability to quickly exclude affected devices through custom field settings. This allows for rapid remediation without affecting other devices.

**Q: Can we add our own custom solutions to this framework?**   
A: Yes, the Device Standards framework is designed to be extensible. You can develop additional standardization solutions following the same pattern and incorporate them into your overall device management strategy.

**Q: How do these solutions handle different versions of Windows?**  
A: The solutions are designed to work across supported versions of Windows, with logic that adapts to different operating system versions and editions. However, always test in your specific environment before widespread deployment.

**Note:** This framework is designed to be extensible. Additional device standardization solutions can be added in the future to address evolving organizational needs and technological changes.
