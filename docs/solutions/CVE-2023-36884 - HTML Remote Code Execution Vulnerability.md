## Implementation

1. Import the Monitor ([SEC - Internal Monitor - CVE-2023-36884 - HTML Remote Code Execution](<../cwa/monitors/CVE-2023-36884 - HTML Remote Code Execution.md>))
2. Import the Dataview ([SEC - Dataview - CVE-2023-36884 - HTML Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Audit [Script]](<../cwa/dataviews/CVE-2023-36884 - HTML Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Audit Script.md>))
3. Import the Alert Template (**△ Custom - Autofix - CVE-2023-36884 - Mitigation Apply**)
4. Validate the script was also imported and assigned to the alert template. ([SEC - Script - CVE-2023-36884 - HTML Remote Code Execution Vulnerability](<../cwa/scripts/CVE-2023-36884 - HTML Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Autofix.md>))
5. Apply the alert template to the monitor
