## Purpose

The purpose of the solution is to find the computers where a vulnerable application is installed, as specified in the provided [JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mttaggart/electron-app-tracker/main/electron_apps.json) file.

**WARNING:** It's important to note that the information obtained through this automated process may not achieve absolute accuracy, given its reliance on comparing application names with those listed in the provided [JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mttaggart/electron-app-tracker/main/electron_apps.json) file. Therefore, it is advisable to exercise human judgment when interpreting the data presented in the [WebP Vulnerability Report](https://proval.itglue.com/DOC-5078775-14166221) dataview, in order to accurately discern the applications that are genuinely vulnerable.
