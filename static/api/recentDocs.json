The creation of these remote monitors is based on system properties, as well as client-level, location-level, and computer-level Extra Data Fields (EDFs), which are further explained in this document.\n\nThe script generates remote monitors that trigger an alert when a user or group of users is promoted to domain administrator on a Windows domain controller. By default, it excludes the domain administrators created by the [Windows Domain Admin Process](/docs/47f6e5ab-064e-4f15-86e6-226a274b73dc) solution. Additionally, the system properties, detailed further in the document, can be used to exclude specific users if necessary.\n\nThe generated remote monitor `ProVal - Production - New Domain Admin` will use the [Get-NewDomainAdmin](/docs/414e5b68-23ca-4c24-8aa1-0dc464a4a10a) agnostic script to perform the monitoring. The monitor set will be created for one domain controller per domain to avoid any duplicate alerts/tickets from multiple domain controllers for the same user.\n\n**File Path:** `C:/ProgramData/_Automation/Script/Get-NewDomainAdmin/Get-NewDomainadmin.ps1`  \n**File Hash:** `934A0A3CD8A38BE3EA8B39C8440D8DBB7FB0833B914E197BDE6A4C9C8C27711D`  \n\n**Note of Caution:** The remote monitors created by this script use PowerShell for monitoring. Therefore, their functionality is not guaranteed on computers running a version of PowerShell older than 5. Please ensure that your systems are updated to at least PowerShell version 5 for optimal performance."

You can generate one or more API keys for your account. To generate a new API key:\n>\n> - Users with an Administrator role can navigate to Account > Settings.\n> - Click on API Keys > Custom API Keys.\n> - Enter a name for the key and click Generate API Key. You will not be able to view a key again after it has been generated.\n> - For security, an optional Password Access setting is provided for each API key. Password values can be accessed from the Passwords API only if this setting is enabled.\n> - To generate multiple API keys, click the plus sign icon.\n\n2. Install the StickySync.dll in the Plugin Manager of Automate.\n3. Restart the Database agent.\n4. Restart your Control Center.\n5. Once your Control Center is back up, head over to Tools > StickySync.\n6. Enter your API key and click \"Apply\".\n\n![Image1](../../static/img/docs/1cbfc0a3-378c-43d4-a890-082779e05310/image1.webp)\n\n7.

Once that is complete, head over to the Passwords section.\n9. You can Sync individual passwords from Automate to ITGlue here, or sync them en-masse with the \"Sync All\" button. Selecting the \"AutoSync\" checkbox for a password will ensure that the password in ITGlue is always the same as the password in Automate.\n    - The \"Sync All\" button is contextual. If you are filtering the passwords list by a specific client, then the button will only \"Sync All\" passwords for that client.\n\n![Image3](../../static/img/docs/1cbfc0a3-378c-43d4-a890-082779e05310/image3.webp)"

The creation of these remote monitors is based on system properties, as well as client-level, location-level, and computer-level Extra Data Fields (EDFs), which are further explained in this document.\n\nThe script generates remote monitors that trigger an alert when a user or group of users is promoted as local administrators on the endpoint machine. By default, it excludes the `Domain Admins` ($Env:DOMAIN/Domain Admins) group from generating tickets, as well as local administrators created by the [Windows Local Admin Process](/docs/f8c0fb81-16ab-4ba2-85ce-d84792a49f6b) solution. Additionally, the system properties, detailed further in the document, can be used to exclude specific users if necessary.\n\nThe generated remote monitor `ProVal - Production - New Local Admin` will use the [Get-NewLocalAdmin](/docs/a79af7f1-2ef6-4769-bf7f-b0214e198ac1) agnostic script to perform the monitoring.\n\n**File Path:** `C:/ProgramData/_Automation/Script/Get-NewLocalAdmin/Get-NewLocalAdmin.ps1`\n\n**File Hash:** `D841B4464A5CE301454990B53896118EC57427935335AEDD116024559BA89FFC`\n\n**Note of Caution:** The remote monitors created by this script use PowerShell for monitoring. Therefore, their functionality is not guaranteed on computers running a version of PowerShell older than 5. Please ensure that your systems are updated to at least PowerShell version 5 for optimal performance.\n\n**Exclusion Tips:**\n\n- The word `Domain` can be used to define a domain user or group in the exclusion.  \n  Example: If the exclusion is \"Domain/Domain Users,\" then the script will intelligently exclude the \"Domain Users\" group for all domain-joined computers.\n- Adding \"Domain/Batman, Batman\" to the exclusion system property will exclude both local and domain user \"Batman\" from generating alerts."

The solution comprises various components that work together to automatically identify and fix these issues. In cases where an agent is deemed beyond repair, the solution generates a report to notify the concerned parties.\n\nIt is essential to note that this solution relies on the CW RMM+ plugin and its proper configuration. The plugin acts as the backbone of the solution, providing the necessary functionality for automated remediation and reporting. As such, it is vital to ensure that the CW RMM+ plugin is correctly installed and configured to enable the smooth operation of the solution. Any misconfiguration or issues with the plugin may result in the failure of the solution to operate as intended, leading to delays or inefficiencies in the restoration of ConnectWise Automate agents."

This script returns a [system-object] with information about the physical disk, its performance, partitions, logical drives, and storage system. The solution also includes a ConnectWise Automate script, EPM - Disk - Script - Disk - Gather Critical Data, which executes the agnostic script and stores the data in a custom MySQL table. The data is displayed in a ConnectWise Automate dataview called CWM - Automate - Dataview - Disk - Critical Data. The solution includes two internal monitors: EPM - Disk - Internal Monitor - Execute Script - Disk - Gather Critical Data, which runs the script once a week on Non-Virtual Windows workstations, and EPM - Disk - Internal Monitor - Predictive Hard Drive Failure, which alerts on any machine with detected errors over the past 7 days. Overall, the solution provides comprehensive data on hard drive performance and failure to aid in preventive maintenance."

When using multiple router addresses, each address must be separated by a space and a comma (\"Router Address 1\", \"Router Address 2\", \"Router Address n\").\n\n### Sample Screenshots\n\n**Multiple Router Addresses:**\n\n![Sample screenshot for multiple Router Addresses](../../../static/img/docs/b8313365-d95d-41bd-b2fc-e3e77f4fdcf7/image_1.webp)\n\n**Single Router Address:**\n\n![Sample screenshot for single Router Address](../../../static/img/docs/b8313365-d95d-41bd-b2fc-e3e77f4fdcf7/image_2.webp)\n\nThere is an option available in the monitor set to use router addresses without quotes; however, in that case, you will not be able to use multiple router addresses for any of the locations.\n\nTo use a single router address without quotes, you can uncomment the line `#ON FIND_IN_SET (a.routeraddress, b.scrouteraddress) <> 0` in the additional condition, followed by commenting the very next line.\n\n**Single Unquoted Router Address:**\n\n![Sample Screenshot for single unquoted router address](../../../static/img/docs/b8313365-d95d-41bd-b2fc-e3e77f4fdcf7/image_3.webp)"

    "Summary": "The automated internal monitor is configured to run the [EPM - Data Collection - Script - HP iLO - Health Report - Get](/docs/f28ef90e-ba80-4ba1-9bd6-e4aa4c2b549a) script every week. Its functionality relies on the method used to store credentials for the HP iLO device in the client-level password tab.\n\n- If the password entry title follows the format `iLO Automation Password - \\\\\\\\<iLO Device Name> (\\\\\\\\<Computer ID to Connect to the device>)`, the monitor will execute the [EPM - Data Collection - Script - HP iLO - Health Report - Get](/docs/f28ef90e-ba80-4ba1-9bd6-e4aa4c2b549a) script using the specified Computer ID enclosed within parentheses.  \n  Example: iLO Automation Password - DeviceName3\n\n- If the password entry title follows the format `iLO Automation Password - \\\\\\\\<iLO Device Name>`, the monitor will execute the [EPM - Data Collection - Script - HP iLO - Health Report - Get](/docs/f28ef90e-ba80-4ba1-9bd6-e4aa4c2b549a) script against a random computer from the same network as the IP address stored in the `URL` field of the password entry.  \n  Example: iLO Automation Password - DeviceName2\n\n**Note:** If the iLO IP is bound to a port, it is mandatory to provide the IP with its port in the URL section of the password tab. This is valid for both options. The objective is to ensure that the [EPM - Vendor Specific - Dataview - HP iLO Health Report](/docs/163aca22-cc56-45ee-9732-3873c6117e60) dataview is consistently updated with the latest data, eliminating the need for manual script scheduling for each computer associated with an iLO device.\n\nIf the script is executed by the internal monitor and the Computer ID is not specified in the password entry, or if the monitor set cannot locate any online computer on the client's network that matches the network of the IP address specified in the URL field of the password entry for the HP iLO device, then the script will execute to create a ticket, but data collection will not be performed.\n\nSuccessful execution of the script requires either a Computer ID or a valid and accessible computer within the specified network."

The corresponding dataview, [Chromium Browsers Credit Card Autofill Lockdown - Status](/docs/cf2a1fb5-3667-4c4a-b0c8-2a600f191980), displays whether the Autofilling feature has been successfully deactivated for each installed Chromium browser.  \n**Note:** This functionality is exclusive to Chromium-based browsers, as the ability to manipulate these settings via registry keys is not available for Firefox browsers.\n\n**Address Autofill Lockdown:**  \nThe [Lockdown Chromium Browsers Address Autofill](/docs/0f88cca8-1b15-44ba-92dc-ec6e2c72377b) remote monitor modifies the computer's registry settings to disable the Autofilling feature for addresses in Chromium-based browsers. The corresponding dataview, [Chromium Browsers Address Autofill Lockdown - Status](/docs/1909b914-8e27-4487-ae47-0d28ad848a5b), displays whether the Autofilling feature has been successfully deactivated for each installed Chromium browser.  \n**Note:** This functionality is exclusive to Chromium-based browsers, as the ability to manipulate these settings via registry keys is not available for Firefox browsers.\n\n**Password Manager Lockdown:**  \nThe [Lockdown Browsers Password Manager](/docs/864f3eaf-4693-42f5-8852-9e96c451c8e8) remote monitor attempts to disable the Password Manager in specific web browsers. It’s important to note that for Chromium-based browsers, disabling the Password Manager won’t stop the Autofill feature if it’s enabled and there are saved passwords. However, new passwords won’t be saved, and the browser won’t prompt to store passwords. For Firefox, disabling the Password Manager will also disable Autofill. The corresponding **dataview**, [Browsers Password Lockdown - Status](/docs/6f3ffa7f-a21e-416d-ba2f-7450a95f3ad7), displays whether the Password Manager has been successfully deactivated for each installed browser.\n\nThis solution provides a comprehensive approach to managing and monitoring the security settings of web browsers, thereby helping to protect sensitive user information."

    "Summary": "Gathers and returns information about each applicable volume and their requested threshold for space remaining. The script has two modes: Dynamic and Static.\n\n### Dynamic Mode\nIn Dynamic mode, the script uses the [Get-VolumeExhaustionEstimate](/docs/21bc13d3-b2fb-42d5-8f38-da9b43990e06) script to generate data points for the size of the volume over time. Once the number of data points crosses a threshold (defined by the parameter `MinimumSamples`), an estimation of the volume space X days before exhaustion is generated (where X is the value of `DaysToLead`). This estimation is then returned as a threshold for the target volume.\n\nIf not enough samples have been gathered or the [Get-VolumeExhaustionEstimate](/docs/21bc13d3-b2fb-42d5-8f38-da9b43990e06) script fails to download, the script falls back to Static mode.\n\n### Static Mode\nIn Static mode, a `hashtable` array is passed into the `ThresholdDefinitions` parameter. Each hashtable must have the following name-value pairs:\n\n```powershell\n@{\n    MaxSize = value1 # The maximum size for this threshold (1GB, 200GB, 1TB ...)\n    ThresholdType = value2 # The type of threshold (Percent or Number)\n    Threshold = value3 # The value for the threshold. 1 - 100 if ThresholdType is percent, otherwise can be any number greater than 0.\n},\n@{\n    MaxSize = value4\n    ThresholdType = value5\n    Threshold = value6\n},"

    "Summary": "This solution, built for the ConnectWise platform, aims to identify all offline computers in the ConnectWise Automate application that are online or missing from the ConnectWise Control application, and subsequently install or repair the Automate Agent on those machines. To achieve this, a ConnectWise Automate script called [EPM - Data Collection - Script - Get - CW-ControlAPI - Online Status*](/docs/71ac312f-e490-4126-bc2d-f9c07f5582cf) is used, which fetches the online status of all machines from CW Control on a periodic basis.\n\nFollowing this, the solution uses a ConnectWise Automate internal monitor named [CWM - Control - Monitor - Agent - CW Control Needs Repair](/docs/b06ee4ed-7da2-41cd-88f0-e9ddba25e6f7) to detect the offline machines that are online in Automate but not in Control, based on the results of the EPM - Data Collection - Script - Get - CW-ControlAPI - Online Status* script. This monitor is then assigned a ConnectWise Automate alert template named △ CUSTOM - Autofix Action - Repair CW Control, which is configured to run the autofix script named [CWM - Control - Script - CW Control - Repair [RMM+, Autofix, Globals]](/docs/43225bbe-98a0-4352-8fb2-79e7431dea10) on the machines identified by the internal monitor.\n\nThe ConnectWise Automate autofix script, CWM - Control - Script - CW Control - Repair [RMM+, Autofix, Globals], attempts to repair the issue with the installed CW Control instance and can generate a ticket if the fix fails. By using this solution, all offline machines can be identified, and the connectivity issues with the CW Control instance can be resolved effectively."

    "Summary": "The ultimate objective of this solution is to establish and oversee two scheduled tasks designed to update installed applications utilizing Winget on Windows 10 and 11 machines within the environment.\n\n- The `Winget Update All [System]` task executes Winget's `upgrade all command` upon system boot (after network connection) under the SYSTEM context.\n- The `Winget Update All [Logged on User]` task initiates Winget's `upgrade all command` upon user login.\n\n**Note**:  \nExcluding the client/location/computer will remove both scheduled tasks from the associated endpoint(s). By default, \"[WingetUpdateAll_UserTask_Disable](/docs/8c8bc8b0-817e-4903-bd09-90df4c25ab9e)\" at the company, site, and endpoint level is set to \"yes,\" which means disabled.\n\nTo enable the `Winget Update All [Logged on User]`, you need to change the custom field [WingetUpdateAll_UserTask_Disable](/docs/8c8bc8b0-817e-4903-bd09-90df4c25ab9e) to \"No\" for the required company, site, or endpoint level.\n\n![Police Car Light](https://c.tenor.com/8vSJsVW-1pQAAAAj/police-car-light-joypixels.gif)  \nBe aware that user-level scheduled tasks `Winget Update All [Logged on User]` may prompt for UAC to the logged-in user if enabled. ![Police Car Light](https://c.tenor.com/8vSJsVW-1pQAAAAj/police-car-light-joypixels.gif)"

For on-prem partners, if this system property is not set, the ping monitors will be created on the Automate server.\n- The script will send an email to [alerts@provaltech.com](mailto:alerts@provaltech.com) to generate a high-priority ticket in Autotask under the following conditions:\n  - If the system property `Location_Ping_Monitor_Computerid` is not set for a hosted partner.\n  - If the computer ID specified in the system property `Location_Ping_Monitor_Computerid` does not exist in Automate or is offline."

    "Summary": "The script generates a ticket containing information about internal monitors that have been disabled due to failure in the past `2` hours. It explicitly excludes monitor sets with the string `[Disabled]` in their names. This script is necessary because disabled monitors cannot independently create tickets about their status.\n\nThe script features an option to enable the disabled monitor sets, controlled by the system property `MonitorFailureCheck-EnableAutofix`. Setting this property to `1` activates the `Autofix` section of the script.\n\nWithin the Autofix section, there is an additional option to create a ticket if the script fails to enable the disabled monitor sets. This ticketing capability is governed by the system property `MonitorFailureCheck-AutofixFailureAlerting`. Setting this property to `1` enables the creation of `autofix` failure tickets.\n\nThe script can generate two types of Autofix failure tickets, each controlled by specific system properties:\n1. **Immediate Autofix Failure Tickets:** The script generates a ticket if the total number of remaining disabled monitors (excluding intentionally disabled ones) exceeds the value stored in the system property `MonitorFailureCheck-MaxAllowedDisabledMonitors` after an autofix attempt.\n2. **For Problematic Monitors:** The script creates a ticket for monitor sets that remain continuously disabled despite repeated Autofix attempts. Automate persists in disabling these monitors. This behavior is controlled by the system properties `MonitorFailureCheck-ThresholdDays` and `MonitorFailureCheck-ThresholdTimes`. The ticket contains information about monitor sets that have been disabled for more than the number stored in `MonitorFailureCheck-ThresholdTimes` within the past number of days stored in `MonitorFailureCheck-ThresholdDays`.\n\nThe ticket category for all tickets created by the monitor set can be defined in the `MonitorFailureCheck-TicketCategory` system property.\n\nThe `MonitorFailureCheck-EmailAlerts` property offers the option to enable email alerts in case of a failure."

As there is no provision for a silent or remote connection to the Office 365 portal using Office 365 credentials, the script utilizes the [Using PSCredential object](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-powershell/blob/dev/docs/authentication.md#client-credential-via-client-secret) method for this purpose.\n\nTo effectively use this script, it is imperative to have the Office 365 ClientID, TenantID, and Client Secret. This information can either be supplied as user parameters when running the script or stored in the client-level EDFs as detailed in the article below.\n\nPlease note that this script is designed for professional use and requires a certain level of technical expertise for successful execution. It is recommended to thoroughly understand the script and its requirements before running it.\n\n**Note of Caution**: Its functionality is not guaranteed on any computer running a version of PowerShell older than 5. Please ensure your systems are updated to at least PowerShell version 5 for optimal performance."

If no time is selected after four attempts, the script will schedule the restart after 48 hours. \n\nAdditionally, the script will display the number of available patches before installing them and inform the user of any patches that failed to install via a popup message. Furthermore, if the script schedules a restart after 48 hours due to user inactivity or failure to select a time, it will send another popup message before forcibly restarting the computer. \n\nWhile the script can be executed from Automate, it is recommended to utilize it from the [Tray Menu](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Automate_Documentation/060/020/010#:~:text=setting%20this%20value.-,Tray%20Menus,-The%C2%A0Tray%20Menus) within an agent template for a better user experience.\n\n**Note:**  \n- The logo displayed in the sample prompts is for exemplary purposes only. The prompter will fetch and display the logo from the concerned Automate environment.\n- The machine will be restarted immediately if the user selects the `Reboot Now` button for a `Post Patch Reboot Confirmation` prompt."

    "Summary": "Remote monitors do not have the ability to perform \"Send fail after success\" style actions like internal monitors do. This autofix will help a remote monitor behave more like an internal monitor. This \"autofix\" should be implemented in scenarios where a client would like to use \"Default - Create Automate Ticket\" but allow for the ticket to automatically close if the remote monitor changes statuses. Note that this is a function script and cannot be run manually. This script is also an offline machine script, meaning it can run even if the agent is offline.\n\n**Time Saved by Automation:** 5 Minutes"

The script includes basic troubleshooting steps to ensure a smooth patch installation process.\n\nHere's an overview of the script's functionalities:\n\n1. The script generates an initial ticket, conducts fundamental troubleshooting for initial patching, validates patch manager WUA settings, attempts to install the most recent Cumulative Update, and logs the outcome in the ticket.\n2. If the computer goes offline while the script attempts to install the latest available Cumulative Update and the PowerShell script fails, the Autofix script will automatically reschedule itself to run again after 4 hours.\n3. If successful, the ticket is closed; otherwise, a failure comment is added.\n4. The `Out_of_Date_CU-Autofix_for_Servers` system property can extend the Autofix section to servers if set to `1`.\n5. The script does not force a computer to restart but recommends it. For environments with the [Solution - User Prompt for Reboot](/docs/32d2254e-c2a4-4f2d-a029-b74f6d3c8b1a), it marks the `Pending Reboot` EDF to prompt users for a restart and closes the initial ticket upon successful reboot.\n6. If the solution is not in place, the script adds a comment in the initial ticket to prompt a restart at the earliest convenience.\n7. The script tracks post-reboot installations, rescheduling itself every 12 hours to monitor system uptime. If a Cumulative Update is installed within X days (Configured in `Out_of_Date_CU-Autofix_Threshold` system property), it closes the ticket; otherwise, it adds a failure comment or creates a new ticket.\n8. The script handles offline machines, rescheduling itself based on offline duration (4 hours, 12 hours, or terminating after 30 days).\n9. It accommodates machines in maintenance mode, rescheduling an hour after the maintenance window ends or terminating future schedules if the maintenance mode lasts more than 30 days.\n10. Optionally, email alerts can be enabled by setting the value of the system property `Out_of_Date_CU-EmailAlerts` to `1`.\n11. `Out_of_Date_CU-Disable_Autofix_for_Workstations` system property determines whether Autofix should be applied to workstations. Setting it to `1` will disable Autofix for workstations.\n12. `Out_of_Date_CU-Autofix_Threshold` system property Specifies the threshold (in days) for identifying outdated cumulative updates, replacing the previously hardcoded 75-day limit.\n\nThis script comprehensively manages Cumulative Update installations, ensuring efficient handling of various scenarios, including offline status, maintenance mode, and appropriate alerts for non-integrated partners."

    "Summary": "This document explains how Windows determines the input system settings, such as keyboard language.\n\nThe input language setting determines the layout of the keyboard. For example, an English (United States) input locale will have a QWERTY layout, while a French (France) input locale will use an AZERTY layout. This allows you to type in a language different from the display language used by your operating system.\n\nFor instance, if your system locale is set to English (United States) and your input locale is set to French (France), your system will display text in English, but you will be typing using a French keyboard layout. This scenario is common on multilingual systems or when users prefer a keyboard layout different from the default layout of their system language."

Once these settings have been modified, click **Save** and then click **Rescan Network**.\n\n   ![Image](../../../static/img/docs/132a68a2-5d49-49b5-994f-4baf4606f816/image_2.webp)\n\n### Credential Configuration\n\n5. Confirm that you have configured the proper credentials for the VMware host. This can be done from the **Global Settings**.\n\n   Global Credentials are used if you have an ESXi password that you share between multiple clients (not recommended).\n\n   ![Image](../../../static/img/docs/132a68a2-5d49-49b5-994f-4baf4606f816/image_3.webp)\n\n   The other option (recommended) is to manually set the credentials through the Local Credentials section and select the proper password from the client or location:\n\n   ![Image](../../../static/img/docs/132a68a2-5d49-49b5-994f-4baf4606f816/image_4.webp)\n\n   If you do not have credentials saved at the client or location, you can add them with a quick shortcut by selecting \"new credential\" from the dropdown:\n\n   ![Image](../../../static/img/docs/132a68a2-5d49-49b5-994f-4baf4606f816/image_5.webp) \n   ![Image](../../../static/img/docs/132a68a2-5d49-49b5-994f-4baf4606f816/image_6.webp)  \n\nIf the above steps are fine, please check the steps below:\n\n1. From the Control Center, open the Computer Management Screen of the Probe agent, then open File Explorer and look for the *C:/Windows/LTSVC/Plugin_VM.txt* log file on the probe machine.\n2. Verify that the VMware host is being scanned. If the IP address does not appear in the log, refer to the above section on **Probe Configuration**.\n3. Check for an error message similar to the one below associated with the IP address of your VMware host:  \n   *The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send.....InnerException: Authentication failed because the remote party has closed the transport stream. This indicates that you must modify the ciphers allowed on the VMware host.*\n\n   **Note:** Once you have modified the host, you must re-run the network probe detection. This can be done by restarting the LabTech service on the probe machine. Go to the **Services** tile of the **Computer Management** screen, right-click on the **LTService**, and select **Restart**.\n\n4. Try to manually apply the credentials to the network device itself and run a test through the network device.\n\n   ![Image](../../../static/img/docs/132a68a2-5d49-49b5-994f-4baf4606f816/image_7.webp)\n\n   ![Image](../../../static/img/docs/132a68a2-5d49-49b5-994f-4baf4606f816/image_8.webp)\n\nIf none of the above steps help, please reach out to us at [Support@provaltech.com](mailto:Support@provaltech.com)\n\n</div>"

    "Summary": "The script aims to facilitate the installation of Windows updates on computers using the [Deep Freeze Tool](https://www.faronics.com/assets/DFS_Manual.pdf). It follows the process outlined below:\n\n- **Ensure THAWED State:** The script will verify if the computer is in the THAWED state (a state that allows changes to be made). If not, it will restart the computer in THAWED mode.\n- **Push Windows Updates:** Once the computer is in the THAWED state, the script will initiate the command to push available Windows updates to the system.\n- **Allow Installation Time:** The script will grant an hour for the Windows updates to install on the computer.\n- **Restore FROZEN State:** After the installation time elapses, the script will restart the computer, reverting it back to the FROZEN mode (a state that restricts changes and preserves the system in its original state).\n\n**Note:** It is essential to run the script a few hours before regular working hours to minimize any potential impact on user experience. The script may involve multiple computer restarts and could take up to 2 hours to complete the entire update process. It is crucial to exercise caution and perform appropriate testing before implementing the script to ensure smooth update deployment. By adhering to the recommended schedule and taking necessary precautions, we aim to facilitate seamless Windows updates without disrupting users during their regular working hours."

Verify the authenticity of the download URL for the application. The download URL may either be the custom link generated to retrieve a file from LTShare or the direct download link for the .msi package.\n\n9.

Setting it to 0 will disable the ticketing feature of the script.\n   - `DownloadURL`: **(Step 5)**: This is the URL from which the .msi package can be downloaded.\n   - `SoftwareName`: **(Step 7)**: This is the exact name of the application as it appears in the software tab of a machine where it has already been installed.\n   - `AppName`: **(Step 9)**: This is the name used to store the .msi package on the endpoint. It’s recommended to avoid spaces or special characters in the package name.\n   - `AdditionalParameters`: **(Step 11)**: These are the extra parameters required to install the script, apart from the `msiexec /qn /i \\\"<Package Path.msi>\\\"`. For example, if the complete command to install an application named ABC is `msiexec /qn /i \\\"C://Temp//ABC.msi\\\" /noreboot ACCEPTEULA`, then `/noreboot ACCEPTEULA` should be stored in this variable."

    "Summary": "This solution is designed to display a specific set of information about the applications installed on a machine. It aims to help users quickly and easily identify what software is installed on their computer. The displayed information includes the name of the application, the version number, and the date the application was installed. This information is presented in a clear and easy-to-read format, making it simple for users to identify the software installed on their machine.\n\nThe \"CWM - Automate - Script - Windows Installer Properties [DV]\" script is a tool that gathers a set of properties for the applications installed on a machine. The gathered information includes properties such as the product name, version, installation date, and more. The script is designed to collect information only for the applications listed in the `software` table.\n\nThe gathered information is stored in a custom SQL table named \"pvl_win_installer_properties.\" Users can review the gathered information in the \"Windows Installer Properties [Script]\" dataview, which presents the information in a tabular format.\n\nIt is important to note that the information presented in the dataview is directly fetched from the machine. If there is no data available for a particular property, the corresponding cell in the dataview will be blank. This indicates that the data is not present on the machine itself.\n\nOverall, these tools provide a comprehensive solution for managing and monitoring the applications installed on a machine. Users can easily access the gathered information in the \"Windows Installer Properties [Script]\" dataview, and the data is conveniently stored in the \"pvl_win_installer_properties\" table for future reference. The inclusion of the note regarding blank cells ensures that users understand the limitations of the data presented and can interpret it correctly."

The `AutomateBackup_Computerid` property should store the computer ID of the machine where the backup data will be saved. If the computer ID is offline or does not exist in Automate, it will send an email to [alerts@provaltech.com](mailto:alerts@provaltech.com) with the details of the problem. This will trigger a high-priority ticket in ProVal’s Autotask system to resolve the issue.\n\nThe script will also use another system property called `AutomateBackup_Base_Directory` to determine the destination path for the backup data. If this property is not configured or left blank, the script will default to `C:/CWA Solutions Backup`. If the variable is not correctly defined in the property, it will default to `C:/CWAutomate`.\n\nBy default, the script only backs up or exports the changes made to the customizations. It will export all the contents during the first run and then only the changes made since the last run from the next run. The user can use the `FullBackup` parameter to force a full backup of everything.\n\nSource: [https://forums.mspgeek.org/files/file/17-script-backup/?_fromLogin=1](https://forums.mspgeek.org/files/file/17-script-backup/?_fromLogin=1)"

Therefore, the `- 7 Days` and `- 30 Days` columns will only be accurate once the `Days Since Data Collection` reaches 7 and 30 days, respectively. Until then, calculations are based on the available data in the [pvl_automate_connection_audit_daily](/docs/da608773-1677-4247-a161-ea62b3b3ba23) table.\n\nAdditionally, the `Days Since Data Collection` column may not be precise, with a possible variance of up to ±23 hours from the actual data saved time. It shows rounded-off information.\n\nAs a result, it is normal for the `Online - 30 Days` or other columns to display `6 days 23 hours 39 minutes` while the `Days Since Data Collection` column shows `6 days`."

These are usually machines where the agent was reinstalled, and the old agent was never cleared out of Automate. Duplicate machines can pose issues for licensing, as well as introducing unnecessary confusion and complexity to the environment.\n\n**Note:** This dataview specifically references the `biosver` column in the computers table. This is where Automate attempts to store the serial number or service tag of the machine. If the manufacturer of the machine does not include a proper service tag or serial number, this dataview will not work. For example, all Supermicro machines use `123456789` as their serial number. This may also be the case with any \"home-built\" machines. Automate is not 100% effective at gathering the serial number or asset tags. Virtual machines are excluded as well."

By default, the script creates a JSON report. If the `Export_CSV` parameter is enabled, a corresponding CSV report will also be generated.\n\nWhen the `Email_Report` parameter is set to 1, the script will send out the generated report(s) via email. By default, the report(s) will be sent to the user running the script unless a specific email address is provided in the `Email_Address` user parameter.\n\nIf both `Export_CSV` and `Email_Report` parameters are enabled, the script will send two separate emails, each attaching the corresponding report. This is because multiple files cannot be attached to the same email from Automate.\n\nPath to the reports on the local machine:\n- `C:/ProgramData/_Automation/Script/Invoke-WingetProcessor/Softwarelist.json`\n- `C:/ProgramData/_Automation/Script/Invoke-WingetProcessor/Softwarelist.csv`\n\n**Requirement:** PowerShell v5+"

Additionally, there is an option to authorize a system restart if the update necessitates it, which can be accomplished by providing a '1' in the user parameter for reboot. \n\nThe script will endeavor to remove the targeted update without initiating a system restart when the reboot parameter is either left blank or set to '0'.\n\n**Caution:** It's worth noting, however, that in certain scenarios, the update itself may trigger an involuntary system reboot."

A value of 1 will \"Prevent Outlook from Connecting to an Office 365 Account,\" while a value of 0 will \"Allow Outlook to Connect to an Office 365 Account.\""

Therefore, their functionality is not guaranteed on any computer running a version of PowerShell older than 5. Please ensure your systems are updated to at least PowerShell version 5 for optimal performance."

    "Summary": "This script is triggered from the monitor [Reboot Pending [Prompt]](/docs/8163996f-f8b6-4b7d-b5b1-6b965a9408d4). The script prompts the user to reboot with a simple yes or no prompt. There are three EDFs that get imported with the script:\n\n- **Pending Reboot** [Checkbox - Manually Editable]  \n  ![](../../../static/img/docs/1789b867-61db-436d-ac0b-07d5aac3f4b8/image_1.webp)\n\n- **Last Prompted** [Text Field - Non Editable]  \n  ![](../../../static/img/docs/1789b867-61db-436d-ac0b-07d5aac3f4b8/image_2.webp)\n\n- **Times Prompted** [Text Field - Non Editable]  \n  ![](../../../static/img/docs/1789b867-61db-436d-ac0b-07d5aac3f4b8/image_3.webp)\n\nIf the user chooses to suppress the prompt by hitting no, it will update the Last Prompted and Times Prompted EDFs with new information. The Last Prompted EDF outlines the date and time when the script recorded that the user was prompted and the script was run. The Times Prompted EDF is increased by one every time the script runs.\n\n**Note:** If the `proval_RebootPromptWhenPendingReboot` system property is set to `1` and the computer has a reboot pending flag, but the `Suppress Reboot` policy is applied by the patch manager and the pending reboot flag was set due to a patch job, the machine will be excluded from the script's functionality. Instead, the prompts and reboot will be managed by Automate's built-in `Suppress Reboot` policy. This may result in inconsistently connected machines not getting a proper reboot."

    "Summary": "This monitor set is designed to check the drive space of devices and generate alerts based on defined thresholds. Here's a breakdown of how the monitoring system works:\n\n1. **Threshold Levels:**\n   - **Global Threshold:** A default threshold value defined at the global level.\n   - **Group-Level Threshold:** A threshold value defined at the group level, which takes precedence over the global threshold.\n   - **Computer-Level Threshold:** A threshold value defined at the computer level, which takes precedence over the group-level threshold.\n\n2. **Alert Generation:**\n   - The monitor checks the drive space for each drive on the device.\n   - If the drive's space falls below the defined threshold (global, group-level, or computer-level), an alert/ticket is generated if Autofix fails to clear some space.\n\n3. **Ticket Closure:**\n   - Tickets generated by the solution for low drive space are automatically closed once the free drive space grows larger than the respective threshold by the relevant variance.\n   - This feature prevents the system from continuously creating and closing tickets too frequently.\n\n4. **Drive Letters to Monitor:**\n   - Drive letters to monitor can be set at the group or computer level using EDFs (Extra Data Fields).\n   - If specific drive letters are not set, the solution will monitor all available internal drives on the device.\n\n5. **Limitation to Windows Computers:**\n   - The monitoring system is limited to Windows computers only.\n\n6. **Configuration via EDFs and System Properties:**\n   - The monitor set can be operated and configured using various EDFs and system properties.\n   - Further details about these configuration options are provided in this article.\n\nOverall, the monitoring system is designed to track drive space and generate alerts based on defined thresholds at the global, group, or computer level. It offers flexibility through EDFs and system properties for customization and configuration.\n\n**Note:** The monitor will not detect machines in maintenance mode."

Here are the key points and functionality of this autofix script:\n\n1. **Monitoring Drive Space:**\n   - The monitor set detects machines where the drive space is lower than the Upper Threshold.\n   - The script keeps monitoring the machine until the drive space goes below the Lower Threshold.\n\n2. **Disk Cleanup and Ticket Creation:**\n   - The script continues to reschedule itself for the specific computer until the drive space falls below the Lower Threshold.\n   - Once the drive space falls below the Lower Threshold, the script executes a disk cleanup process.\n   - If necessary, the script creates a ticket to alert administrators or responsible parties about the low drive space condition.\n\n3. **Maximum Offline Duration:**\n   - The script includes a mechanism to handle machines that remain offline for an extended period.\n   - If a machine is consecutively offline for 72 hours, the script schedules itself for a maximum of 72 hours against that machine.\n   - This ensures that the autofix script remains active and ready to address the drive space issue once the machine comes online.\n\n4. **Ticket Closure:**\n   - Once the free drive space grows larger than the respective Upper Threshold (Threshold + Variance), the script closes the associated ticket.\n   - This allows the monitoring system to avoid continuously creating and closing tickets when the drive space fluctuates around the threshold.\n\n**Note:**\n- Detailed information about Threshold, Variance, EDFs (Extra Data Fields), and System Properties can be found in the documentation or specifications of the [monitor set](/docs/f7235a0b-b6b6-456d-8af3-bd3471b1e70f).\n- These parameters and configurations provide flexibility for customizing the monitoring behavior and adapting it to specific environments and requirements."

This script will exit if run against a Domain Controller; otherwise, it will execute its normal functionality. The approved local admin group members can be set into the system property and EDFs described further in the document.\n\nThe local account `Administrator` and the `Domain Admins` group (if the computer is joined to a domain) will be automatically approved. There is no need to add these entries to the system properties or the EDFs. Additionally, if the [Windows Local Admin Process](/docs/f8c0fb81-16ab-4ba2-85ce-d84792a49f6b) is enabled in the environment, the user created by this solution will also be added to the approved list.\n\n**File Path:** `C:/ProgramData/_Automation/Script/LocalAdminCleanup/LocalAdminCleanup.ps1`\n\n**File Hash (SHA256):** `D4D17978915A5E8C4ACEA920A7E5BD4AF9BDB1A9566B8515D06D0819A1BA4150`\n\n**File Hash (MD5):** `FD2BD4D384461ECD62562330696630E0`\n\n**Tips:**\n\n- The word `Domain` can be used to define a domain user or group in the exclusion.  \n  Example: If the allowed local admin is `\"Domain/Domain Users\"`, then the script will intelligently add the `\"Domain Users\"` group to the local admin group for all domain-joined computers.\n- Adding `\"Domain/Batman, Batman\"` to the approved local admin system property will add both the local and domain user `\"Batman\"` to the local admin group for all domain computers."

    "Summary": "The remote monitor is trying to turn off the Password Manager in specific web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Brave. The solution involves making changes to the computer's registry.\n\nIt's important to know that for browsers based on Chromium (like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Brave), turning off the Password Manager won't stop the Autofill (or Sign in Automatically) feature. If Autofill (or Sign in Automatically) is enabled and there are saved passwords, it will still automatically fill in credentials for websites. However, if the Password Manager is disabled, new passwords won't be saved, and the browser won't ask to store passwords. The saved passwords will still work.\n\nFor Firefox, turning off the Password Manager will also disable Autofill.\n\n**Affected Setting for Google Chrome:**  \n![Google Chrome Setting](../../../static/img/docs/864f3eaf-4693-42f5-8852-9e96c451c8e8/image_1_1.webp)\n\n**Affected Setting for Brave:**  \n![Brave Setting](../../../static/img/docs/864f3eaf-4693-42f5-8852-9e96c451c8e8/image_2_1.webp)\n\n**Affected Settings for Microsoft Edge:**  \n![Microsoft Edge Setting](../../../static/img/docs/864f3eaf-4693-42f5-8852-9e96c451c8e8/image_3_1.webp)\n\n**Affected Settings for Mozilla Firefox:**  \n![Mozilla Firefox Setting](../../../static/img/docs/864f3eaf-4693-42f5-8852-9e96c451c8e8/image_4_1.webp)\n\n**Note:**\n- The changes will only take effect once the browser is restarted if it's currently open. In certain situations, especially for Microsoft Edge, the user might need to restart the entire computer for the changes to take effect.\n- If the PowerShell version on the machines is older than version 5, the remote monitor may not produce the expected outcomes."

Once that is complete, head over to the Passwords section.\n   - You can Sync individual passwords from Automate to ITGlue here, or sync them en-masse with the \"Sync All\" button. Selecting the \"AutoSync\" checkbox for a password will ensure that the password in ITGlue is always the same as the password in Automate.\n     - The \"Sync All\" button is contextual. If you are filtering the passwords list by a specific client, then the button will only \"Sync All\" passwords for that client.\n\n   ![Passwords Sync](/img/docs/fa3bbc1f-9ceb-4578-bf19-487a619536df/image_3.webp)"

(Gathered in the above steps)\n     - **NOTE**: Sometimes, hitting the save button does not actually save the configuration. Please verify all of the changes made have been saved properly.\n   - Do Build and View Query of the new monitor after the modification.\n\n   ![Image](../../../static/img/docs/b6eac8f7-222b-4c72-8bed-0b81c138074a/image_8.webp)\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: If it detects more than 10 results, and it is **targeting to create a ticket or send an email**, please connect with the account manager before enabling it."

The creation of these remote monitors is governed by system properties, as well as client-level and computer-level Extra Data Fields (EDFs). These elements are further detailed within this document.\n\n**Note of Caution:** The remote monitors created by this script utilize PowerShell for monitoring. Therefore, its functionality is not guaranteed on any computer running a version of PowerShell older than 5. Please ensure your systems are updated to at least PowerShell version 5 for optimal performance."

    "Summary": "The monitor set detects Hyper-V hosts with problematic replication status for virtual machines.\n\nThe replication state/status of a virtual machine refers to the current status of the replication process for that virtual machine. In a virtualized environment, replication is used to create a duplicate copy of a virtual machine's data on another physical machine or storage location. This is done to provide redundancy and protect against data loss in case of hardware failure or other issues.\n\nIf the replication state of a virtual machine is showing as \"Critical\" or \"Warning\", it may indicate that there is a problem with the replication process or that the replication target is not receiving updates. By monitoring this state, administrators can quickly identify and resolve these issues, ensuring the continued availability and integrity of their virtualized environments."
